1. A Chriſtleſs-eſtate A HOPELESSE-ESTATE.

    _ CHAP. I. Being a Vindication of my Sermon preached at N. Sarum, ſhewing that Union to Chriſt, and Juſtification by Chriſt is not Antecedent to Faith.

    _ CHAP. II. Containing a Vindication of my Argument drawn from the Parallel between the firſt and the ſecond Adam, ſhewing that as no man is lyable to condemnation by the firſt Adam, but ſuch as are in him by natural generation, deſcending from him; ſo no man is freed from condemnation, till they be in Chriſt by ſupernatural and ſpiritual regeneration.

    _ CHAP. III. Containing an anſwer to M. Eyre's exceptions againſt my Argument deduced from our union with Chriſt, ſhewing that where there is no union, there can be no communion; his unjuſt charge refuted, and the nature of our union with Chriſt further declared.

    _ CHAP. IV. Shewing four material differences between us, and M. Eyre, wherein he hath departed from the Orthodox faith, concerning the Doctrine of free Juſtification of a ſinner through Faith in Chriſt, reduced unto four ſeveral Queſtions, which are in this Chapter clearly ſtated.

    _ CHAP. V. Containing a brief deſcription of M. Eyre's opinion, ſhewing wherein he departeth from the Orthodox faith, together with a brief Synopſis of the ſeveral errors, unſound opinions, and ſelfe-contradictions, that he hath intangled himſelfe in, in the defending of his errour of eternall Juſtification.

    _ CHAP. VI. Proving that we are not juſtified from Eternity.

    _ CHAP. VI. Shewing that a man is not juſtified actually from the time of Chriſts death.

    _ CHAP. VIII. Shewing that we are juſtified by faith, and that when the Scriptures ſpeak of Juſtification by Faith, it doth not underſtand it only declaratively, but really in the ſight of God, nor objectively excluding the act, and the instrumentality of Faith is proved.

    _ CHAP. IX. Shewing how weakly he hath defended himſelfe againſt the charge of Antinomianiſme, and likewiſe manifeſting that the Authors brought by him in defence of his Errour, do ſome in the ſame place, and moſt of them joyntly bring in evidence againſt his cauſe.

    _ CHAP. X. Containing a vindication of ſuch Scriptures as are brought by Mr. Woodbridge for Juſtification by faith, and miſ-interpreted by Mr. Eyre, together with an anſwer to ſuch Scriptures as he hath brought to defend his Errour of Juſtification antecedent unto faith.

    _ CHAP. XI. Containing an anſwer to thoſe Arguments Master Eyre hath brought to prove the antecedency of Juſtification to faith, that we are actually reconciled from the time of Chriſts death, and that faith is not an antecedent condition of Juſtification.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And for this reaſon we have cauſe to wiſh that many bookes were burnt, eſpecially ſuch as tend to corrupt the ſenſe of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; And of all bookes, ſuch as ſerve to caſt the reader
<pb facs="tcp:118254:3"/> quite off from the foundation, and to turne them aſide to another Goſpel. This cauſed that holy Apoſtle to thunder out an <hi>anathema</hi> againſt ſuch: if an Angel from heaven ſhall preach any other Goſpel, let him be accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. And the truth is, we can never erre more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly then in the doctrine of juſtification; For which cauſe he is of ſmall judgement, and leſſe obſervation, that ſeeth not how needfull it is to have this doctrine kept pure: And eſpecially with you, where<note n="*" place="margin">Mr. William Eyre.</note> one is riſen up amongſt your ſelves, who hath ſown tares in the Lords field, whoſe opinion treads Antipodes to the goſpel, which he hath publiſhed to the world in his booke, which he calleth <hi>Vindiciae juſtifications gratuitae,</hi> which (that I may doe him right) I judge the ſtrongeſt ſhield and buckler, wherewith this Antinomian cauſe was ever protected: Yet as in Salem of old, God brake both ſword and ſhield, ſo I doubt not but he hath done the like now in this enſuing treatiſe (though by a weake hand) making a few ſcripture arguments to pierce this ſhield, and to wound the Cauſe that he maintaines, that it lyes a bleeding at the feet of a ſcripture truth. And for the Authour, I wiſh he had had more reſpect to truth, the churches peace, that he had carried meekeneſſe and love to the perſons whoſe judgement he doth oppoſe, fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with his heart and pen, againſt their arguments, not their perſons: but the want of this is obvious to every eye, his opinion is diametrically oppoſite to the letter of the Scriptures, to the vnanimous Conſent of all orthodox antiquity, and the learned of the preſent age, to the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Churches; and yet he boldly chargeth us, and all that diſſent from him, to be no better then <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Arminians.</hi> And I doubt not but all to whom wee
<pb facs="tcp:118254:3"/> are known, have done juſtice upon this peice of his morali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And for his opinion it ſelf, I queſtion not but every be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever that hath imbraced the truth as it is in Ieſus, (as a ſufficient profeſſour in this controverſie) hath condemned it for Noveliſme, and a dangerous errour, and doe judge that Satans deſigne by him is to draw others, but you e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially (if it be poſſible) from the ſimplicity, &amp; ſincerity of the goſpel received: but I am perſwaded better things of you, and things that accompany ſalvation: Yet I think it meet to ſtirre you up to a diligent examination of the Scriptures, that this Corner ſtone of juſtification in the building of your faith may be layd aright. And whereas Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> hath in the hearing of ſome of you, condemned a Sermon of mine, preached amongſt you, as Anti-ſcriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and my arguments irrationall, and now in his printed booke hath de-cryed it as <q>wide from the orthodox faith as well as contrary to his doctrine, and contradictory to many plaine Scripturrs, and dorogatory to the full atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which Chriſt hath made by his death, and diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolatory to the ſoules of men, in laying the whole weight of their ſalvation upon an uncertaine condition of their owne performing:</q>

<pb facs="tcp:118254:4"/> them one as we are one, and having the righteouſneſs of Chriſt imputed, which is the righteouſneſſe of God himſelfe, he propounded it to the people to conſider, if a Chriſtian were not a certaine divine perſon as the ſonne of God is:</q> And to have been ſilent in this caſe, had been my ſin, eſpecially ſeeing the people were led captive by him into his former errours of <hi>Antinomianiſme,</hi> admirers of his perſon, and of a ductile ſpirit: But that I deſired the people not to beleeve a word which <hi>Mr. Symonds</hi> taught, hath as much truth in it (though <hi>Mr. Eyre</hi> relate it) as that had which was ſpoken to Chriſt concerning the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of the world, All this power will I give thee, and the glory of them, for that is delivered to me, and to whomſoever I will, I give it. And he himſelfe doubted of the truth of it, for he addeth, <hi>how juſtly I cannot tell,</hi> yet in his paſſion to render me odious he relates it, though he be commanded not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive an accuſation againſt an Elder, under two or three witneſſes. But to returne unto you,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 5.18.</note> Right wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipfull, to whom I have been bold to dedicate this little Tractate, I beſeech you in the bowels of Chriſt, receive neither it nor me, but ſo far forth as it is agreeable to the word of truth, and if God hath not given me darkneſs for a viſion, I apprehend a marvellous beauty in the truth here offered unto you, nay already imbraced by you, which <hi>Mr. Eyre</hi> ſtriving <hi>tanquam pro aris et focis,</hi> ſeeketh to undermine. I beſeech you ſtand faſt in the truth, and in the love of it. The raine fell as impetuouſly upon, the floods did ſwell with as great rage againſt, and the winds did ſtorme with as great violence, the houſe built upon the rock, as that, which was built upon the ſands: And the truth of Chriſt that is built upon the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures

I plead not for faith ſo as to ſet the crowne upon her head which is due to Chriſt alone, ſhee is content to be the
<pb facs="tcp:118254:8"/> friend of the bridegroom, neither ſeeketh ſhe to ſhare with Chriſt in the honour of Salvation. Faith is content, and all that have it, to wither in their reputation, it is fit that Chriſt ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, and we decreaſe, we plead not then to have faith to be a corrivall with Chriſt, to be a ſociall, and coordinate cauſe in the juſtification of a ſinner. And yet wee cannot but give it that office which God hath aſſigned to it, to be an inſtrumentall cauſe of juſtification, wherein it hath the praecedency above all other graces, as being the only inſtrument ordained of God to receive Chriſts righteouſneſſe, and ſo not only to be a neceſſary antecedent of ſalvation as other graces are, which are neceſſary <hi>neceſſitate medii,</hi> and are <hi>cauſae diſpoſitivae</hi> of ſalvation, but this is neceſſary by way of cauſality for the application of Chriſts righteouſneſſe unto juſtification. And when we ſay, that we are juſtified by faith, we underſtand it not by faith as a work, or a grace, as an act, or as an habit, by vertue of any innate worth, excellency, and dignity in faith; we do not take it <hi>ſenſu proprio,</hi> in whole, or in part, as <hi>Arminians, Papiſts, and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinians</hi> doe, in making it the matter of our righteouſneſſe, but when that is ſpoken of we underſtand it <hi>metonimicè,</hi> tropically, by relation to its object, for what man that is not a profeſſed Papiſt, and enemy to the free grace of God did ever dreame of juſtification by faith without an object, you may as well dreame of a man without a ſoul as to be juſtified without Chriſt. Yet when we take faith tropically, for the object of faith, we do not take faith excluſively, (although we ſo apprehend it when you ſpeak of the matter of our righteouſneſſe) as if faith had no hand in juſtification, no not by way of application of Chriſts righteouſneſſe, as if by the word faith, were underſtood Chriſt, ſurely this were not to keep our wits company And if it were the Apoſtles meaning to exclude faith from having any hand in juſtification upon any tearmes whatſoever, ſurely he would not ſo darkly have expreſſed himſelf by a figurative expreſſion,
<pb facs="tcp:118254:8"/> when he might have done it more clearly by putting in the name Chriſt for faith, as <hi>Mr. Eyre</hi> would teach us to doe. Wee willingly grant that Chriſt is the meritorious cauſe of juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification which he ſeemeth to me to deny, (making juſtification an<note n="*" place="margin">Chriſtis not the meretorious cauſe of any immanent act in God.</note> immanent and not a tranſient act, as we doe) we alſo grant that Chriſts active, and paſſive obedience is the matter of our righteouſneſſe, and the formal cauſe of juſtification is the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of this righteouſneſſe, without any works of ours. Yet this no way excludes faith from being an active inſtrument to apply this righteouſneſſe to us, (faith it is our act, although it be Gods gift, it is our inſtrument wrought in us by God for our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, to apply by his ordination the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to juſtification.) For as the efficient cauſe excludeth not the meritorious, ſo neither doth the meritorious exclude the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentall, which <hi>in ſuo genere,</hi> in its kind, is as neceſſary as the other; for <hi>bonum eſt ex integris cauſis:</hi> but I ſhall more fully open this in ſtating of the controverſy, and will not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore anticipate my ſelfe any further, but ſhall referre the reader thither for further ſatisfaction, where I intend to handle this controverſy more largely, though I deſire the reader to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice that I ſhall chieflly meddle with that in <hi>Mr. Eyres</hi> his book, which relates to my ſelfe, and purely belongs to this controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, leaving that which belongeth to <hi>Mr. Woodbridge,</hi> that I may not <hi>falcem in alienam meſſem immittere,</hi> put a ſickle into another mans harveſt.

And for as much as he hath wronged both me, and the truth, in relating what I ſaid not, (<hi>viz.</hi> that I ſhould ſay that the union between Chriſt and the Saints was a perſonall union, which I called a union of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, but not a perſonall union) and hath repreſented our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in as unhandſome a dreſſe to render me contemptible, I am the leſſe troubled (though I rejoyce at no mans ſin) know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he is a man of hard language, and moroſe carriage un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to many of my brethren, of farr more eminent worth, and eſteem in the Church of Chriſt then my ſelf. And for that ſlaunder, where he ſaith, that I compared him to Judas, and my ſelf to Chriſt, I doe ſolemnly beſeech him to remember what God hath threatned to him that loveth and maketh a lie,<note place="margin">Rev. 22.15.</note> and to take heed how he beareth falſe witneſſe againſt his neighbour, where he hath God, angels, and men, and his owne conſcience to contradict him, leaſt God impute that as ſin to him, which he feareth not to commit, it may be upon this ground, becauſe he judgeth it to be antecedently pardoned before it is committed. My expreſſion for which he blameth me was this, I ſaid to him, What? are you come out againſt me as againſt an heretique, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb facs="tcp:118254:9"/> you know whether that which I hold be a hereſy, or that I am obstinate in the defence of it? moreover, at the request of friends, that heard my Sermon, (with which <hi>Mr. Eyre</hi> hath dealt as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> with the male children of the Iſraelites) ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving given way to the publiſhing of it (not doubting but when it cometh under the cenſure of my brethren, but they will do the ſame office for it that the religious midwives did for the male children, to ſave it alive from the hand of the oppreſſour) I conceive, I was ingaged to ſome further act towards the end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, &amp; laying this controverſy aſleep, eſpecially ſeeing <hi>Mr. Eyre</hi> ſaith, <hi>Mr. Woodbridg</hi> did but blow the coales that <hi>Mr. War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren</hi> had kindled, whereas this fire was kindled long before by himſelfe, and the pulpit turned by him into a cock-pit, to defend this errour. And becauſe ſome are infected, more are in danger, the truth is oppreſſed, the courſe of the Goſpel like to be hindred, and prophaneneſſe, and Antinomianiſme goe hand in hand, and ſpeake with one tongue, as <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> hath well obſerved, I have put my ſelfe upon this taske of confuting his conceit. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, his diſ-ingenious deſcription of our conference, by intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing interlocutours, as if I were <hi>ad incitas redactus,</hi> and that they did interpoſe to helpe me (for it ſeemeth to me to be his end in that relation) hath made me willing to wipe off that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquie by entring the lists once more with him, whereas the true cauſe of that interruption was, his popular appeales, his uſuall artifice to evade the force of an argument, &amp; to enthrone himſelfe as victor, in the hearts of the in-judicious multitude. In a word, the enſuing reaſons were no ſmall motive to inforce me to this work, The bridge of juſtification by which men muſt paſſe over from death to life is very narrow, and one step awry may be the loſſe of many pretious ſoules, and all goſpel truth is a pretious <hi>depoſitum</hi> concredited to us miniſters of the goſpel, and is a part of that<note n="*" place="margin">2 Tim. 1.14.

<pb facs="tcp:118254:10"/> to the Saints,<note place="margin">Aug ad Lauren cap. 64.</note> and this doctrine of juſtification is <hi>articulus ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis, vel cadentis Eccleſiae</hi> (as <hi>Luther</hi> ſaith) the Church ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, or falleth according as this truth is beleeved, or violated, and what Auguſtine ſaith of remiſſion of ſins, that I may ſay of faith, by which remiſſion of ſins is received, <hi>per hanc ſtat Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſia, quae in terris eſt, per hanc non perit, quod perierat, et inventum eſt.</hi> And therefore there is a neceſſity of keeping this doctrine pure, and every miniſter is bound to preſerve this truth, and to keep the <hi>Philiſtins</hi> from throwing dirt into this well. And if <hi>Shamma</hi> be recorded in Sacred writ for defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a field of lentills, againſt the <hi>Philiſtins,</hi> ſurely it cannot but be acceptable to God and man, to defend that doctrine which is the ſumme of the goſpel, confirmed with the blood of Chriſt. And if it were <hi>Pauls Eulogium</hi> to preach that faith, which he did once deſtroy, it cannot be <hi>Mr. Eyres encomium</hi> to deſtroy that faith he ought to preach. And ſeeing God himſelf taketh care of the very haires of our head, and numbers them all, we have much more reaſon to make a precious eſteeme of that truth which is worth all our heads, and by which our very ſoules muſt be ſaved, And no leſſe care ought we to have of the honour of Chriſt, and of his myſticall body. For who is he that is a living member of Chriſt, that is not ſenſible of the diſhonour done to Chriſt our head, and what diſhonour is done to Chriſt by this doctrine, by making an unbeleever a ſubject of juſtification, and a member of Chriſts body, let him that is leaſt in the Church judge. The Apoſtle could not without an <hi>abſit</hi> thinke of it that a member of Chriſt ſhould be joyned to a harlot: ſhall I take the members of Chriſt, and make them the member of a harlot? God forbid: and is it not an annoynted truth of the ſame authority,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6.15.</note> that I muſt not take a harlot (ſo remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) and make it the member of Chriſt? If <hi>Mezentius</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for a wicked tyrant, for tying a dead man to a living perſon, can he be eſteemed a good Chriſtian, and friend to
<pb facs="tcp:118254:10"/> Chriſt (not to ſay a good miniſter) that ſhall joyne an unbeleever dead in ſins and treſpaſſes, as a member unto Chriſt? the Lord give him the ſight of this evill, and God forbid I ſhould ceaſe to pray for him, and I hereby beg a Collection of praiers for him from all that know him, for I beleeve his owne principles will not ſuffer him to pray for the pardon of ſin, which in his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is pardoned long before it is committed. And now that I might not trouble the Reader any further, I will but mention a paſſage or two in his Epiſtle dedicatory, and another in his booke, and I will not hold him from the diſcourſe it ſelfe. <hi>Mr. Eyre</hi> hath in his ſecond page of that Epiſtle perfumed his brethren oppoſite to his errours, to render them acceptable to the magiſtrate: <q>It is remarkable <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> that they, who aſcribed unto magiſtrates a definitive, and coercive pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in ſpirituals, have (when magiſtrates would not ſerve their turns) denied the power, which they have in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porals, refuſing contrary to the rules of Chriſt, to own them, pray for them, or to yeeld obedience to their law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full commands, as if none muſt hold the ſword, but ſuch as will uſe it to fight their quarrel, and to effect that by force of arms, which they themſelves cannot doe by ſtrength of argument.</q> But is this an irrefragable argument to prove eternall juſtification? or a lively demonſtration of a man parboiled in his paſſion? is this the effect of charity? or the foame of a paſſionate man? was he ſick of a fever? or troubled with the ſcurvy when this paſſage fell from him? I am ſure there is neither charity nor verity in it, if it be examined by the law of God, or the knowne lawes of the land: if he be able, let him produce any proofe of our diſobedience to authority, leaſt the world ſay he hath <hi>linguam mentiri doctam.</hi> But nothing is more uſuall then for the nocent to accuſe the innocent,<note n="*" place="margin">1 K. 18.17. 4 Eph. 3.</note>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Arg. </seg>1</label> to this end, the firſt is drawn from their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral eſtate; O Epheſians, if ye conſider your ſelves in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon eſtate of nature, you will finde that ſuch was your conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that you could not be delivered from it but by grace: which Argument he amplifies by a ſixfold conſideration of their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral condition.</p>
            <p>Firſt, in the ſtate of nature, they were not onely defiled with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> ſinne, but were altogether dead in ſinnes and treſpaſſes, and were no more able to help themſelves, then the dead is able to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:118254:14"/> ariſe from the grave; and therefore unleſſe the ſame Almighty power that raiſed Chriſt from the dead, had beene exerted to quicken them, they could never have beene ſaved.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> In the ſecond place, <hi>verſe</hi> 2. He telleth them that their whole life was a life of ſinne, though they were dead to grace, and ſpiritual life, yet they were alive to ſinne.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Yea thirdly, that they lived after the cuſtome of natural and unregenerate men, who did minde and ſavour onely the things of this life.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> And fourthly, that they lived as thoſe that had Satan, the God of this world for their guide, and were ſo farre from being led by the Spirit of God, that the ſame uncleane ſpirit, and ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to mans ſalvation did rule them, which now effectually work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the children of diſobedience.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, in the third <hi>verſe</hi> he ſheweth that they had their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation in the luſts of the fleſh, doing what their vaine minde did dictate, &amp; their corrupt appetite and ſinful affections did deſire</p>
            <p>Sixthly, The Apoſtle amplifies this by compariſon, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> that the eſtate of himſelf, and the beleeving Jewes, was no better then theirs, both in reſpect of ſinne, and puniſhment, being all by nature the children of wrath as well as others.</p>
            <p>In the fourth <hi>verſe</hi> the Apoſtle layeth down a ſecond Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Argument </seg>2,</label> to prove the freeneſſe of Gods grace in our ſalvation, drawn from the Author of our ſalvation &amp; the inward impulſive moving cauſe, prevailing with him to do this for us; the rich Author is God, the moving cauſe his free love: but God who is in mercy, for the great love wherwith he loved us did deliver us.</p>
            <p>In the fifth <hi>verſe</hi> he ſhewes the order of Gods diſpenſing grace to us, and that is by the redemption of Chriſt, amplified from the time, that while we were yet dead in ſinnes God quickened us with Chriſt, and therefore by grace we are ſaved, that is, while we were dead in ſinnes and treſpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, a Covenant paſſed between God and Chriſt our Redeemer, and God gave us unto Chriſt, that by him we ſhould be redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and when he raiſed Chriſt, he gave us a pledge of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption and juſtification in him.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> In the ſixth <hi>verſe</hi> he telleth us that we are not only quickened and raiſed to life, begotten to a living hope of eternal life, but we were in a manner raiſed with him, and aſcended with him as
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:118254:14"/> in our head, and ſet down together with him in heavenly ace, spl that is, in reſpect of our right purchaſed, we had it before faith, but in reſpect of actual poſſeſſion and application of theſe mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies this is not conferred upon our perſons untill we do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve.</p>
            <p>In the ſeventh verſe the Apoſtle ſheweth what end God had in all this, <hi>that in the ages to come be might ſhew the exceeding riches of his grace, and kindneſſe towards us in Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the eighth <hi>ver.</hi> he concludes from his former diſcourſe, <hi>that therefore we are ſaved by grace;</hi> And goeth on to prove it by a third Argument taken from the meanes whereby this grace is received and applied: we are ſaved by grace, becauſe we are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by faith; where faith is taken metonymically, for Chriſt appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by faith, yet not excluding faith as a meanes to apply Chriſt to us; and that which is due to Chriſt, is attributed to faith, becauſe it alone is the onely inſtrument to apply Chriſts righteouſneſſe unto juſtification. Now the Apoſtle to prevent a miſtake, leſt any ſhould think becauſe faith is our act, that therefore we are ſaved by ſomething in us; he anſwers, that though it be our Act, it is Gods gift, and therefore we cannot challenge any thing in the work of Salvation, becauſe we are paſſive in this work; it is a grace wrought in us by God, to apply Chriſt to us, and therefore in 9. <hi>verſe</hi> he removes all works, whether performed by grace, or nature, from being the cauſe of our ſalvation, knowing how deeply this error is rooted in all men by nature, to ſeek righteouſneſſe in themſelves: and he gives a reaſon why God will not have ſalvation by works, becauſe as they cannot ſtand with grace, as faith may, ſo they are enemies to the glory of God, and will lift up the heart of man to glory in himſelf; therefore God will have it to be by grace, received by faith, that no man might boaſt.</p>
            <p>In the tenth <hi>verſe,</hi> the Apoſtle having ſhewed that our ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is only of grace, and the meanes by which we are made ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of all ſaving good in Chriſt by faith, excluding all cauſes in man leſt he ſhould boaſt; he layeth down a new reaſon, why we cannot be ſaved by works, becauſe in the work of regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we are wholly Gods workmanſhip in Chriſt created to good works; and we are as meerly paſſive in this work, as in the firſt work of creation; for as no creature contributed any
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:118254:15" rendition="simple:additions"/> thing to its own being; and as there was no diſpoſition in man to make himſelf a man, ſo there is naturally no ability in us to contribute any thing to our new creation; therefore ſeeing all we have, and are inabled to do, is by grace, we are not ſaved by our own works; and to prevent an Objection concerning works, (for works being excluded from being a cauſe of ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,) then ſome might aske, What place have they? and why are they required? the Apoſtle anſwers, they are of neceſſary uſe, though not to purchaſe ſalvation, yet they are the way wherein ſalvation muſt be had; for God hath ordained before, that we ſhould walk in them.</p>
            <p>In the 11th. &amp; 12th. <hi>verſes,</hi> The Apoſtle that he might the better affect their hearts with the greatneſſe of Gods mercy, and freeneſſe of his grace to them; he puts them in minde of their former eſtate in Gentiliſme, as if he ſhould ſay, Do but remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber what once you were; caſt but an eye upon your former eſtate, and compare it with your preſent; and your very change will evidence this truth, that ye are ſaved by grace.</p>
            <p>Now this wretched and deplorable eſtate, he ſetteth down in ſeven things: Two whereof are ſet down in the 10th. <hi>verſe,</hi> the reſt in the 11th. <hi>ver.</hi> which I have choſen for my Text.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, remember that ye were Gentiles in the fleſh, living according to the fleſh, ſo that in that eſtate they could not pleaſe God.</p>
            <p n="2">2.

And in the Text here are five evils more that he would <hi>have them remember:</hi>

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, That at <hi>that time ye were without Chriſt;</hi> that is, as <hi>Diodat</hi> upon the place obſerveth, <hi>ye had neither union, nor communion with Chriſt,</hi> who is <hi>Head of the Church, the Foundation,</hi> and Mediatour of the Covenant, and the Spring of all ſpiritual, and everlaſting bleſſings.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, They were aliens from the common-wealth of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and ſo ſeparate from Chriſts body, which is the Church; they had no communion with the Church.</p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:118254:15"/>
            <p>Thirdly, They were ſtrangers from the Covenants of Promiſe, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> that is, as <hi>Bains</hi> obſerves, <q>
                  <hi>they had no propriety in the Covenant, or promulgation of the Covenant;</hi>
               </q> and as <hi>Diodat</hi> upon the place, <hi>having no interest nor portion in the goods promiſed by the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, which was made with</hi> Abraham; and ſo often reiterated and confirmed, or as <hi>Dickſon</hi> upon the place, <q>having no right to application of the promiſes,</q>

            </p>

               </note> Mr. <hi>Eyre,</hi> 
               <q>in his <hi>Vindiciae juſtificationis gratuitae, who makes the ſenſe &amp; meaning of theſe words to be thus:</hi> The Elect before faith have no knowledge or comfort of Gods gracious volitions towards them, or of Chriſts undertakings, and purchaſes in their behalfe, in which reſpect they are ſaid to be without Chriſt, and without God in the world; As if they were not ſo really, but to their appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions;</q> they did apprehend themſelves to be without Chriſt, and without God, and without hope in the world, but were not; as if he ſhould ſay, They were miſtaken, their eſtate was good enough, but they wanted faith to give them the knowledge, and comfort of it; which is to contradict the ſcope and end of this place, which is to ſhew what a change God had wrought by place, as the next words declare.</p>
            <p>I wonder with what fate he can thus groſſely corrupt the ſenſe of the Holy Ghoſt, when as the plain ſcope, and meaning of the words, is to minde them of their former miſery, before conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or actual faith; they were a Chriſtleſſe-people, without all actual communion with Chriſt, the Spirit of Chriſt had not yet drawn them to Chriſt, nor united them to him, nor did he yet dwell in their hearts by faith; but in reſpect of any real,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:118254:16"/> actual communion with Chriſt in reſpect of Juſtification, or Sanctification; they were as if there were no Chriſt, and they were without communion with the Church, without the means of grace and ſalvation, in a very ſad, hopeleſſe-eſtate, without any intereſt in God, or any true ſaving knowledge of him.</p>
            <p>My purpoſe is not to ſpeak to all of theſe, but only to the firſt of them, which I ſhall take as it is in conjunction with that other expreſſion in the Text, that they were without hope.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Obſerv.</note>The Obſervation then I ſhall inſiſt upon is this, That a Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe-eſtate, is a Hopeleſſe-eſtate: And where there is no union to Chriſt, that ſoul is without hope; this is the head of all ſpirituall miſery to be without Chriſt, this makes a ſoule to be without God, and without hope in the world;<note place="margin">Rom. 8.32.</note> let a man have Chriſt, and he ſhall with Chriſt have all things; but let him be without Chriſt, and then he hath nothing, he is under wrath, poor, wretched, miſerable, blinde and naked. In the opening of this Point, I will oſerve this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I will inquire what it is to be without Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I will confirme it by Scripture and Reaſon, that a Chriſtleſs-eſtate is a Hopeleſſe-eſtate.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I will ſhew you, that before actual faith, even the Elect of God are in a Chriſtleſſe-eſtate, in this hopeleſſe-condition; and then will apply it.</p>
            <p>Firſt, What is it to be without Chriſt, and how could the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſians</hi> be ſaid to be without Chriſt, when they were Elect per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and redeemed by Chriſt? The Apoſtle ſpeaketh not here of Gods counſel, and purpoſe, for ſo he intended to give Chriſt to them, and them to Chriſt; yet for all that they were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chriſt, for this is <hi>terminus diminuens,</hi> and did not put them into a ſtate of actual union to Chriſt, nor doth he look upon the price of redemption paid for them; for they were notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this without Chriſt: but he ſpeakes in regard of actual application,<note place="margin">So <hi>Baines</hi> upon the place.</note> and thus they were without Chriſt; they were <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>abſque Christo, ſeorſum à Christo.</hi> Now this may be underſtood in two reſpects:</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, They were without the means wherein God offers, and exhibits Chriſt; for, though God had given Chriſt for them, he had not yet given Chriſt to them, they had not the offers of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:118254:16"/> Chriſt made to them in the Goſpel, while they were Ethnicks and ſtrangers to the Common-wealth of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> thus they were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chriſt, becauſe without the ſaving knowledge of Chriſt; and ſo were in a hopeleſſe-eſtate, till God did reveale Chriſt to them; and thus as <hi>Paul</hi> tells the <hi>Corinthians, If the Goſpel be hid, it is hid from them that are lost,</hi> they are a loſt people to whom the Goſpel is hid. Now it is hid two wayes:</p>
            <p n="1">1. When it is not revealed, and thus where no viſion<note n="a" place="margin">Prov. 2918.</note> is, the people periſh; And they that ſit in<note n="b" place="margin">Iſa. 9.2. Matth. 4.16.</note> darkneſſe, ſit in the region and the ſhadow of death.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When it is<note n="c" place="margin">2 Cor. 4.4.</note> hid from a people in regard of the ſaving light, and efficacy of it; and in both theſe ſenſes the Goſpel was hid from them; for they had not Chriſt the<note n="d" place="margin">Col. 1.27.</note> hope of glory preached to them, the<note n="e" place="margin">Eph. 3.8.</note> unſearchable riches of Chriſt was not yet revealed to them, much leſſe was Chriſt revealed<note n="f" place="margin">Gal 1.16.</note> in them by the powerful illumination and effectuall operation of the Spirit of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Secondly, A man is ſaid to be without Chriſt, when he was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> never united to Chriſt, and made one with him; when he never had any real communion with Chriſt; when Chriſt did never<note n="g" place="margin">Eph. 3 17.</note> dwel in his heart by faith, and he was never united to Chriſt by his Spirit, when they were never implanted into Chriſt by faith: Thus the <hi>Epheſians</hi> were without Chriſt, they were not ſo much as in him by external profeſſion, much leſſe by my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical implantation; there was never any mutual act between Chriſt and them, Chriſt exhibiting himſelf to them, and they adhering, and dwelling in Chriſt by faith; they had not the Spirit of Chriſt working an unity of wills, a confederacy of affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, a participation of natures, a concurrence to the making up the ſame body; and this is here principally intended.</p>
            <p>And thus the greateſt number of men and women that live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſound of the Goſpel are without Chriſt, and were never in him to this day.</p>
            <p>Now all that are thus in a Chriſtleſſe-eſtate, are in a hopeleſſe-eſtate; let no man flatter himſelf, &amp; think that becauſe Chriſt the Son of God died for ſinners, they ſhall be ſaved by giving a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral aſſent to this truth: I tell you, Chriſt himſelf ſhall not ſave you, unleſſe you be united to him by faith; We <hi>preach,</hi> ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, <hi>Chriſt in you, the hope of glory</hi>

And as for that dream of calling inherent works by the Name of Chriſt, if any ſo do, we abhorre it with him; yet ought we not, becauſe ſome abuſe the Scripture, there<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ore to loſe the benefit of any <hi>ſaving truth;</hi> and ſeeing Chriſt doth really dwell in us by faith, we fear not to aſſert this without the ſuſpition Familiſme. Miſtake me not, I do not ſay that Chriſt dwelleth in Beleevers by any perſonal inhabitation, ſo as to make an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtalical union; but by the graces and operation of his Spirit; and unleſſe he thus dwell in thy ſoul, and be united to thee, thou canſt not be ſaved. As the man-ſlayer could not be ſafe, if the avenger of blood found him out of the City of refuge; And as <hi>Lot</hi> was not ſafe till he was in <hi>Zoar:</hi> So Chriſt in our City

And as none were ſaved that did hang about the Ark when the flood came, but they that were got into the Arke, and ſhut up in it; ſo none that do hang upon Chriſt only by external profeſſion, ſhall be ſaved, but ſuch as get into Chriſt by myſtical implan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.

Such is the diſtance and difference between God and the ſouls of men, that none is found worthy, or able in heaven or earth to umpire this difference, but Chriſt; and were he not a perſon of infinit worth, he could never make any ſatisfaction, nor work a reconciliation; <hi>We are dead in ſins and treſpaſſes,</hi> and none but Chriſt that is the Lord of Life can quicken us; we are ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually blinde, and were not Chriſt God, he could not cure our blindneſſe; for it was never<note n="r" place="margin">John 9.32.</note> known from the beginning of the world, that any but God could open the eyes of the blinde. None but Chriſt who is the<note n="ſ" place="margin">Heb. 1.3.</note> brightneſſe of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Glory, and the expreſſe Character of his Image, is able to reſtore Gods Image in us; without which, we ſhall never ſee the face of God, nor can God take us for his children, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in us, unleſſe this were reſtored; ſuch is the oppoſition made againſt our ſalvation by Satan, and all the powers of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that none but Chriſt is able to deliver us from this ſtrong man. So great is the myſtery of godlineſſe, that none but Chriſt who hath lien in the boſome of the Father, and knowes all things, could reveal the Father to us, whom to<note n="t" place="margin">John 1. 18.

Now this will appear by induction, if you conſider all the unions in the world; there is no communion between thoſe, where there is not an antecedent union. In the marriage-union, there is no communion as man and wife, till the marriage-union be made; in the naturall communion between the ſoul and body, the head and the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:118254:19"/> the graft and the ſtock; diſſolve the union, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion is deſtroyed. In the Politick communion between a people, unleſſe united under one government. So in all others, and why not in the myſtical union between <hi>Chriſt</hi> and us? Hence ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi>

And he that hath but the firſt-fruits of reaſon muſt acknowledge this; and take one place for all, to ſhew that all the benefits that come by Chriſt, follow upon our union to Chriſt. In the<note n="c" place="margin">1 Cor. 1.30.</note> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. <hi>But of him are ye in Chriſt Jeſus, who of God is made unto us wiſdome, and righteouſneſſe, ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, and redemption.</hi> So that firſt we are in him before he is made of God unto us, wiſdome, righteouſneſſe, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now I come to the third particular, and that is to ſhew you that before actual faith there is no actual union to Chriſt, and ſo no ſpiritual communion with him in his death, not actuall hope of eternal life.</p>
            <p>Now for the fuller vindicating of this Propoſition, and what I have hereafter laid down in the defence of it againſt Mr. <hi>Eyre's</hi> Exceptions or Cavils, rather I referre the Reader to the following diſcourſe, where I will purpoſely undertake this taske; becauſe I intend here only to give the world a ſight of that naked truth, as it was delivered without any variation from it, that the world may ſee what reaſon Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> had to condemne it as Heterodox. To return then to the Propoſition delivered, That before actual faith there can be no actual union with Chriſt. That which ſome imagine of an union with Chriſt from eternity, and an union with Chriſt upon the Croſſe when he ſtood as a common perſon; if they underſtand it of an actual u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and implantation into Chriſt, and not of a relative reſpect and virtual union, which yet is an union improperly ſo called; that which they affirme is very irrational: for that union which is the myſtical union between Chriſt and a Believer, by which
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:118254:19"/> we have ſpiritual communion with Chriſt in his death, is the formall effect of faith; by meanes of which Chriſt and we are made one<note n="d" place="margin">Eph. 5.23. 1 Cor. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>0.7.</note> body, and this union neceſſarily requireth the conſiſtence of the perſons united; for that union whereby Chriſt and we are united, is ſuch an union, whereby <hi>the perſon of a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever is united to the perſon of Chriſt, (I called it not a perſonall union, though it be an union of perſons; and although I explained my ſelf ſo, in my conference with him after the Sermon; yet he is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed to tell the world, I hold our union with Chriſt to be a perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall union: but of this hereafter.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now this actual union whereby the perſon of a Beleever is united to the perſon of Chriſt, neceſſarily requires the pre-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence of his perſon, and the antecedency of his faith. And therefore when it is ſaid that God<note n="e" place="margin">Eph. 1.4.</note> choſe us in Chriſt, that is not to be underſtood as if we were then <hi>exiſtentes in Chriſto,</hi> or actually united; but it ſheweth us Gods order how he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes to bring us unto holineſſe, that is, through Chriſt, or for Chriſts ſake; this being an immanent and eternall action, it could not leave any preſent effect upon us, who had no actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, but a mentall exiſtence only in Gods minde, and therefore we could not be actually united: for neither Chriſt as yet had aſſumed our nature into the unity of his Perſon, which was to lay the foundation of the union of our perſons unto Chriſt; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I deny not but the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> before Chriſt, were really united by faith, before the aſſumption of the humane nature.</p>
            <p>Beſides, union to Chriſt is a thing accidental as to the nature of man; now <hi>an accident is not, nor cannot be without its ſubject, (where let the Reader obſerve the forgery of Mr.</hi> Eyre; <hi>that which I ſpake of union with Chriſt, he applies to imputation of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe):</hi> For<note n="*" place="margin">

               <hi>Accidentis eſſe, eſt ineſſe;</hi> now the Believer being the perſon united, and ſo a ſubject of this union, how can union which is an accident ſubſiſt, without man that is <hi>the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject exiſt? And beſides, it is a known rule: Non entis nulla ſunt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentia, nullae ſunt affectiones;</hi> how can any thing be truly predicated of that which is not? Beſides, it is againſt another Principle in reaſon; (and unleſſe we will betray our reaſon to become beaſts, we cannot ſubmit to this new Creed;) <hi>Omnis a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctio fit per contactum:</hi> All action is by ſome contact; which holds good in this ſupernatural action; for by faith we touch Chriſt,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:118254:20"/> not by any local contiguity, but by a ſpirituall contact and apprehenſion, whereby Chriſt is ſaid to dwell in our hearts.</p>
            <p>Now having proved <hi>à priori,</hi> that the Elect before faith are not united to Chriſt, let us <hi>à poſteriori</hi> ſee if the ſame truth will not be concluded from the proper effect of union with Chriſt, which is communion with him in his death unto juſtification, that the Elect are not united before faith.</p>
            <p>Such then as are actually united to Chriſt, are actually juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: But a man is not juſtified actually before faith: Therefore neither united to Chriſt. As for Infants, their caſe is of a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar conſideration, God by his Spirit ſupplying what is wanting through the imbecillity of their age; and hence the Spirit work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>ſemen fidei,</hi> and apprehending them, though they cannot ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend Chriſt, I queſtion not their union to Chriſt, and the imputation of his righteouſneſſe to their juſtification; but we ſpeak now <hi>de adultis,</hi> that none that are of years ſufficient, are juſtified without actual faith. Now that we are not juſtified by an immanent act of God from eternity, nor immediately from the time of Chriſts death, without ſome act of ours inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening for the application of Chriſts righteouſneſſe to juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; will appear,</p>

            <p n="1">1. As by the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> no man is guilty of eternall death, but he that is a member of him by natural generation; ſo Chriſt frees no man from condemnation, juſtifieth and reconcileth no man, till be a member of him by ſupernatural regeneration; but this is not before faith, <hi>John</hi> 1.12. <hi>To as many as</hi>
               <note n="n" place="margin">John 1.12.</note> 
               <hi>received him, to them he gave power to become the ſons of God, even to as many as believed on his Name; Which were borne, not of blood, nor of the will of the fleſh, but of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. If a man be juſtified from the time of Chriſts death ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedently, not only to a mans faith, but to a mans birth, then a juſtified perſon is not borne a childe of wrath, which contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts that of the Apoſtle, where he ſaith of himſelf and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted <hi>Epheſians; Than they were by</hi>

               <hi>nature the children of wrath as well as others.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. A ſin is not remitted before it is committed; But if we be juſtified from the time of Chriſts death, ſin is remitted, before it is committed. The Major is evident, becauſe it is not a ſinne
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:118254:21"/> before committed; and therefore ſeeing it is but <hi>potentially</hi> a ſin, and not <hi>formally</hi> it cannot be actually and formally remitted; nor is it of any great moment, that our ſins were imputed to Chriſt, before they were committed by us. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. It will not eaſily be granted that our ſins were imputed to Chriſt, but only the puniſhment due to ſin was ſaid upon Chriſt; but if it be granted, the reaſon is not alike: for Chriſt to whom our ſin in the guilt of it was imputed, was a perſon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſting.</p>

            <p n="4">4. The whole efficacy of the merit of Chriſts death, in reſpect of the imputation and application of it, depends upon the will of God ordaining it, and accepting of it; for who dares take or apply the merit of Chriſt any other way, or upon any other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition then he hath ordained to communicate it, and to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted for men? And Chriſt as Mediatour was the ſervant of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:118254:21"/> God, ſubmitting his will to Gods will in it; and Chriſt was conſtituted as a Head and Mediatour out of meer grace, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and his will was to be in every reſpect conformable to the will of God.</p>
            <p>Now then ſeeing it was not intended by God, nor accepted of God to procure immediate reconciliation, and remiſſion of ſinnes for any before repentance, and implantation into Chriſt by faith; ſo neither was it the intendment of Chriſt, and ſo no wrong is done to Chriſt, though the benefit of his death be ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended untill actuall faith; eſpecially conſidering, that for Chriſts ſake grace ſhall be given effectually to draw them to faith for whom Chriſt died, therefore none are juſtified actually till faith.</p>
            <p>I might here adde, that the Law being relaxed, to put in the name of a ſurety, whoſe payment was refuſable; hereupon the ſolution being not in this reſpect the ſame in obligation, (for <hi>dum alius ſolvit, aliud ſolvitur</hi>) and ſo being not <hi>ſolutio ejuſdem,</hi> but <hi>tantidem,</hi> the diſcharge doth not immediately follow; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſeeing it was neither the will of God, nor of Chriſt, that an immediate diſcharge ſhould be given, which appeares by Scripture ſtrongly by a negative argument thus, There is no Scripture can be produced from whence, without manifeſt injury to the Holy Ghoſt, this can be drawn by any tolerable conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, that by vertue of Chriſts death all the Elect are <hi>ipſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cto</hi> inveſted with Chriſts righteouſneſſe, and are actually juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied without the intervention of faith; nay, the Scriptures ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely threatning unbelievers with damnation, and limiting ſalvation to Believers, do evidently declare the contrary. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther let any reject this argument drawn from the Scripture nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively; for although this argument be infirme in matters of leſſe conſequence, yet in fundamentals it is of great force; ſuch as this is, by what means this righteouſneſſe of Chriſt ſhall be applied to juſtification; therefore in ſuch truths as concerne our ſalvation, this is of maine importance, it is not written, therefore it is not to be believed. Indeed if Chriſt had merited this abſolutely, that we ſhould be juſtified whether we believe, or not believe, the matter had been otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>And when we make faith the condition neceſſary to juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we do not with Arminians make it a poteſtative uncertain
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:118254:22"/> condition, depending upon the liberty of mans free will; but though it be contingent in reſpect of us, yet it comes to paſſe neceſſarily in reſpect of God, who hath ordained unto faith ſuch as he hath choſen in Chriſt unto ſalvation. And it is an eff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ct of the death of Chriſt, which ſhall be given in Gods ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed time to ſuch for whom Chriſt died. Nor do we make faith a condition of Chriſts acquiring pardon, nor an inſtrument to make his merits ſatisfactory, nor an organical inſtrument of Gods acception of it; Chriſts merits have their worth, whether we believe or not; and Gods will cannot be moved by any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall cauſe; but it is a prerequiſite condition by Gods appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is to be fulfilled by us through his grace working it, whereby Chriſts righteouſneſſe ſhall be applied to us for juſtification. And as for thoſe Scriptures that ſpeak of Gods be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reconciled by the death of Chriſt, they are to be reſtrained to actual Believers, to whom <hi>Paul</hi> wrote his Epiſtles; or if they be indefinitely underſtood of all the Elect, they hold forrh no more then that Chriſt hath by a ſufficient price paid removed the cauſe of enmity meritoriouſly, but not by any formal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of it unto any until faith. And whereas they ſpeak of Gods reconciling us, while enemies, (from whence our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries inferre, that we are reconciled while enemies, antecedent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to faith) this only ſhewes what we were when Chriſt died for us, enemies to God as well as others; but that we are (while we remain ſo) reconciled, is <hi>atheologon,</hi> and not worthy of him that ſavours of the Spirit of grace; nor can any ſober man that keeps his wits company, imagine any ſuch thing in God, who is of purer eyes then to behold iniquity.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Beſides, in the fifth place, it is conſiderable among what ſort of cauſes the death of Chriſt is to be ranked; it is a meritorious cauſe, which is to be numbred amongſt moral cauſes. Chriſt in his death is not to be looked upon as a natural agent, that the effect of his ſufferings ſhould work immediately, but as a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary agent; and hence the effect doth not neceſſarily follow, but at the will of the agent moved thereby; yea, the effect of a moral cauſe, or voluntary agent, may ſometimes precede the cauſe, as in this of the death of Chriſt, by which all that believed in Chriſt to come, were juſtified as well as we, though Chriſt had not as yet made an actuall ſatisfaction by his death; for in this
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:118254:22"/> caſe the effect is wholly at the will of the Agent moved thereby, who together with Chriſt hath ſuſpended the effect untill faith.</p>
            <p>I adde in the 6th. place, <hi>Bonum eſt ex integris cauſis,</hi> and therefore where many cauſes concurre to the producing of one effect, the effect is not accompliſhed till every cauſe hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed his proper influence.</p>
            <p>Now there are three cauſes of mans juſtification, which may therefore be called ſociall cauſes, but not co-ordinate; but the two laſt ſubordinate to the firſt.</p>
            <p>The firſt is the efficient cauſe, that is God of his free mercy.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is the meritorious cauſe, the death and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>The third is the inſtumentall cauſe, and that is ſaith. Now as the efficient juſtifies not without the meritorious, ſo neither doth the meritorious without the inſtrumental, and much leſſe the inſtrumental without the other; but all three conjoyned, conſtitute a perſon actually juſtified in the ſight of God. And whereas they argue, that thoſe Scriptures that ſpeak of juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by faith, are to be underſtood in <hi>foro conſcientiae,</hi> that they do but juſtifie us <hi>declaratively,</hi> and ſerve to <hi>evidence</hi> juſtification, but not to conferre juſtification upon us, neither are we juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by faith (ſay they) in the ſight of God: I will therefore propound three arguments againſt this which is a chief cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner-ſtone in the <hi>Antinomians</hi> building.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That that doth change and alter the ſtate of a ſinner, and put him into a new condition in refrence to God, that doth more then <hi>evidentially</hi> juſtifie: But faith doth thus alter the ſtate of a ſinner; and the <hi>Major</hi> is above contradiction: the <hi>Minor</hi> is no leſſe true, which I prove thus, If before faith a mna is in the ſtate of damnation, and upon believing he be put into a ſtate of ſalvation, and that before God, then faith doth really alter and change a mans eſtate before God: But before faith a man is under condemnation, and upon faith delivered from it: Ergo. <hi>Mr.</hi> Eyre <hi>his anſwer to this was, that the Law did condemne him, but God d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d not; To which I replyed, If the Law be the Law of God, and receive all its power and authority from God, then when the Law condemneth, then God condemneth; But the Law is the Law of God,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:118254:23"/> and hath all its force and efficacy from the will of God. (Now look what anſwer he hath given to Mr.</hi> Woodbridge, <hi>which you may ſee,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Eyre,</hi> p. 112. Num 6.</note> Vindiciae Juſtifica. p. 112. Sect. 6. <hi>the ſame he gave to me, which I ſhall anſwer in its proper place.</hi>)</p>
            <p n="2">2. What the Apoſle denies to Works, he attributes to faith; therefore faith hath an influence into juſtification, which works have not. From whence I argue,</p>
            <p>If faith do only declaratively juſtifie the ſinner, then faith doth no more towards the juſtification of a ſinner then works, becauſe works may evidence my juſtification, as well as faith; but according to the Apoſtle, faith contributes more to juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation then works: <hi>Ergo.</hi> The proof of the conſequence, that works may evidence juſtification, will appear from<note n="p" place="margin">Rom. 8.1.</note> 
               <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. <hi>There is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus, who walk not after the fleſh, but after the Spirit: By this we</hi>
               <note n="q" place="margin">1 John 3.14.</note> 
               <hi>know that we are paſſed from death to life, becauſe we love the Brethren.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Beſides, the controverſie between the Apoſtle and the Juſticiaries of his time, was not, whether faith or works do evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence our juſtication; but by what we are juſtified in the ſight of God.</p>
            <p>From whence I argue, That that makes the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> to aſſert an untruth, that interpretation cannot be true: But if the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Apoſtle had been, <hi>We are juſtified by faith,</hi> that is, faith doth evidence our juſtification, and works do not evidence it, this makes the Apoſtles words to be untrue, and he ſhould uphold a needleſſe ſtrife, and they ſhould be in the truth, and he in an errour. But we ſhall rather ſuſpect this gloſſe, then ſo farre queſtion the credit of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who was <hi>Amanuenſis Spiritûs Sancti,</hi> the Penman of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:118254:23"/> becauſe without the means by which God offers and exhibites Chriſt, though their condition be very ſad; but even of thoſe to whom Chriſt is preached, and ſalvation by Chriſt offered; but yet (alas!) they are as great ſtrangers to Chriſt as if they had never heard of him, they know not what union and communion with Chriſt means, they never were cut off from their old ſtock; but are members of the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> who are yet in their ſins, ready to periſh everlaſtingly for want of union with Chriſt, to give them a right unto his righteouſneſſe; if God ſtop but their breath, which he can as eaſily do as a man would cruſh a moth, they are everlaſtingly undone; and we may ſay of them as Chriſt of <hi>Iudas, It had been good for them they had never been borne,</hi> Let ſuch perſons as theſe are know, that have lived under excellent means, and yet are not drawn to faith, <hi>It ſhall be more tolerable in the day of judgement for the Heathen that never heard of Chriſt, then for them;</hi> if they die in this eſtate, they ſhall not be damned for not believing in Chriſt, for Chriſt was never revealed unto them; but Chriſt have been revealed unto you, the unſearchable riches of Jeſus Chriſt hath been laid open be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your eyes; God hath made many ſweet offers of Chriſt and all his benefits unto your ſoules, when God hath denied to <hi>Dives</hi> a drop of water to coole his tongue; the windowes of heaven have been opened to you, and the fountaines of the great deep of the bottomleſſe mercy of God have been broken up, and the Seas and depths of Gods mercies in Chriſt have been opened to you. One would think the moſt iron-hearted ſinner would be allured with ſuch bowels of mercy as have wept over you, and yet you have received all the grace of God in vain, you have not been brought over unto Chriſt by faith; how will this provoke the Lord to the ſoreſt vengeance, that the hand of a jealous God can inflict? <q>If the word ſpoken by Angels was ſtedfaſt, and every tranſgreſſion and obedience received a juſt recompenſe of reward; how ſhall we eſcape if we neglect ſo great ſalvation?</q> This will be condemnation with a witneſſe, <hi>That light is come into the world, and men love dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe rather then light.</hi> Thou that art not united to Chriſt, thou haſt as yet no part nor portion in Chriſt, thou art yet in the gall of bitterneſſe, and in the bond of iniquity.</p>
            <p>Indeed there is righteouſneſs enough in Chriſt to juſtifie thee;
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:118254:24"/> if all the ſins of all the men in the world did lie upon thee, yet if thou beeſt a member of Chriſt, none of all theſe ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne thee; yea, with reverence be it ſpoken, God can no more condemne thee then he can condemne his Son that died for thee; thou art as ſafe from condemnation, as Chriſt; but thou that art yet out of Chriſt by unbelief, let me tell thee, the very blood of Chriſt cannot ſave thee in this eſtate; God muſt make a new Goſpel, and deny himſelf, or elſe thou canſt not come to heaven.</p>
            <p>What claime canſt thou lay to Chriſts righteouſneſſe, that haſt no intereſt in Chriſt himſelf? will he give his blood to thee, that never gave himſelf to thee? Thou that art a Chriſtleſſe perſon, thou art a graceleſſe perſon; for if God have not made Chriſt righteouſneſſe to thee, to juſtifie thee, he is not made ſanctification to thee, thou art a godleſſe, a hopeleſſe man in this eſtate. As it was ſaid of <hi>Coniah,</hi> ſo may I ſay of thee, <hi>Ob earth, earth, earth, write this man childleſſe, a man that ſhall not proſper all his dayes! he was a broken veſſel in whom the Lord had no pleaſure;</hi> ſo thou art a broken veſſel in whom the Lord hath no pleaſure. Oh earth, earth, earth, write this man graceleſſe, hopeleſſe, heavenleſſe, a man that ſhall not proſper all his dayes! Oh, what a dreadful thing muſt death needs be to thee when thou dieſt, that haſt no Chriſt to intercede for thee, nor righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe to appeare in! If all the haires upon thy head were ſo many vipers in thy boſome, they will not ſting thy body more deadly, then ſin will ſting thy ſoul unto death eternal.

But if it be ſuch a bleſſing to have the Word preached, which is the meanes to beget faith, whereby this union is made; what a mercy is it to that ſoul to whom the Lord hath bleſſed it as a meanes of his inſition into Chriſt, that the preaching of the law hath been in the hand of God, as the Gardners knife by which he hath cut thee off from the old ſtock<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The firſt that I will give is this, There will be much fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in that ſoul that is united to Chriſt; for Chriſt is a very fruitful Vine, and every branch in him bringeth forth much fruit, <hi>John</hi> 15.5. <hi>Every branch that abideth in me, the ſame bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth much fruit.</hi> Where obſerve, that Chriſt is compared to a Vine, and his Members that are really united, not by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion only, are compared to Branches that abide in the Vine; for a dead branch is cut off, and caſt into the fire; and an abiding
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:118254:25"/> branch brings forth much fruit. And as a branch of a Vine, is worth nothing unleſſe it be for fruit, a man cannot make a pin to faſten in a wall of the branch of a Vine; ſo that an unfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Chriſtian is the moſt unprofitable perſon in the world, and there is nothing can be pleaded to keep a dead branch of a Vine from the fire, it is good for no other uſe; if it bring not forth fruit, it muſt ſerve for fuel: So then, all ſuch as are in Chriſt, muſt be fruitful; it is the end why a Chriſtian is ingraffed into Chriſt, to make him fruitful; wherefore doth a man put a graft into another ſtock, but for fructification? this is Gods end in uniting a ſoul to Chriſt.</p>
            <p>God looks for much fruit, and better fruit, as a man would never be at pains to ingraft a cion, unleſſe he did expect better fruit, and more fruit then he had before.<note place="margin">Eph. 2.10.</note> Hence we are ſaid to be Gods workmanſhip in Chriſt, created unto good works; the Lord of the Vine-yard ſent his ſervant to demand ſome fruit;<note place="margin">Mark 12.2.</note> and Chriſt is a very fruitful ſtock, there is much ſap and fatneſs in this ſpirituall root; and it's a diſhonour to Chriſt, the ſtock into which a Chriſtian is planted, if he bring not forth fruit; but what is this fruit? why,<note place="margin">Matth. 3 8.</note> 'tis ſuch as <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> called for, <hi>fruits meet for repentance,</hi> ſuch as may evidence and teſtifie the truth of repentance, and its fruit unto holineſſe, as <hi>Paul</hi> tells the <hi>Romanes; That being made free from ſin,</hi>

               <hi>and become ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God, they had their fruit unto holineſſe.</hi> And in another place, this is called fruits of righteouſneſſe;<note place="margin">Phi. 1.11.</note> when a Chriſtian is filled with the fruits of righteouſneſſe, which are to the praiſe and glory of God; when a man is fruitfull in every good work, both in works of piety towards God, and charity towards men; when there is not only leaves of external profeſſion,<note place="margin">Col. 1.10.</note> but reall fruits of holineſſe, and ſanctification; and obſerve it, it is fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe in every good work; ſo that our fruit muſt be good for the quality, much for the quantity. Art thou ſuch a fruitfull Chriſtian? doeſt thou bring forth fruits meet for repentance? may the change of thy heart be read in the change of thy life? is it ſuch fruit as may evidence the truth and power of grace? art thou no longer a ſervant to ſin, but a ſervant of righteouſneſſe? is thy affection to ſin mortified? <hi>They that are Chriſts,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 5.24.</note> 
               <hi>have cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified the fleſh with the affections, and the luſts thereof.</hi> Art thou like a tree planted by the rivers of water, bringing forth fruit
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:118254:26" rendition="simple:additions"/> in its ſeaſon? do'ſt thou bring forth fruit when God expects it? do'ſt thou bring forth fruit not to thy ſelf, but unto God? as a tree brings forth fruit for the Maſter, ſo do'ſt thou live to God? not onely caring for thy credit, that thy life be unblameable, but that God may be honoured? do'ſt thou abound in the fruits of righteouſneſſe? art thou full of love, peace, long-ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, gentleneſſe, goodneſſe, meekneſſe, faith, humility, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, temperance? He that is not thus fruitful, is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graffed into Chriſt; if thy faith be a dead faith, that doth not manifeſt it ſelf by good works; if thou beeſt barren, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitful in the knowledge of Chriſt, and haſt nothing but the outward leaves of profeſſion, thou wert never truly ingraffed into Chriſt.</p>
            <p>A 2d. note is this, he that is united to Chriſt, lives the life of Chriſt; for it is not he, but Chriſt that liveth in him; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe ſaith <hi>Paul, I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me.</hi> As a branch in the tree, if it be a living branch, partakes of the ſame life; it doth not only cleave by adherence, and continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the body of the tree, but it is in the tree by a real parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of life, partaking of the ſap and influences of the root; thus it is between Chriſt and a Chriſtian, united to him by a true faith,<note place="margin">Acts 3.15.</note> he partakes of ſpiritual life from Chriſt; hence Chriſt is called the Prince of Life,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.45.</note> and a quickening Spirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.45. Now Chriſt is the Root, Author, and fruition of all ſpiritual life in us; and thus he lives in us by his Spirit, which is called the Spirit of life which is in Chriſt, and by this he freeth us from the law of ſin and death;<note place="margin">Rom. 8.2.</note> The ſame Spirit that dwells in Chriſt, dwells in a Beleever, and quickens him; as it raiſed Chriſt from the dead, ſo it doth raiſe up us to newneſſe of life, and ſo to live a life in conformity to the life of Chriſt; which appears in two things, becauſe it makes a Chriſtian live by the ſame rule, and to the ſame end.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By the ſame rule, Chriſt as Mediatour lived according to the written Word of God,<note place="margin">P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>The Law of God was written in his heart;</hi> look what the Law did require, there was a diſpoſition in his heart ſuitable to that Law; and hence Chriſt profeſſed, <hi>He came not to do his own will, but the will of him that ſent him; It was his meat and drink to do the will of his Father:</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 4.34.</note> And in the moſt difficult caſe, wherein he could be tried, though nature
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:118254:26" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſtarted and ſtood amazed at the greatneſſe of the ſufferings, and therefore as man could not but fear the wrath of God; and in this ſenſe he feared, and declined the bitterneſſe of the cup, and deſired it might paſſe away; and unleſſe he had put off the nature and affections of man, he could do no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; yet knowing that immutable purpoſe of God, and for that end he came to this home, in that ſenſe he voluntarily ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; and ſo though here were a diverſity of wills, yet not a contrariety of wills in Chriſt, and truly his will was wholly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the will of God; ſo in ſuch as Chriſt lives by his Spirit, he makes them ſo live, as to make the will of God the rule of their life, and to this end <hi>he writes the Law in their heart,</hi> that they may both know, and have an inward ſuitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Spirit to yield obedience to the will of God: And hence he that hath had communion with Chriſt in his death, is ſaid to ceaſe to ſin, for this end that he ſhould no longer live to the luſts of men, but to the will of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Chriſt made the honour of God his end; thus Chriſt ſaith, <hi>He did honour the Father, and ſought not his own glory;</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 8.49, 50.</note> Thus alſo a Chriſtian that is united to Chriſt, ſeeks that glory of God, and makes that his laſt end, as <hi>Paul</hi> injoynes, <hi>Whatſoever ye do,</hi>

               <hi>do all to the glory of God.</hi> Now if thou art one that doeſt make the will of God the rule of thy life, and obey it from thy heart, making God thy laſt end in all thou doeſt; ſurely this is an infallible ſigne of a man in Chriſt,</p>
            <p n="3">3. That man that is united to Chriſt, cannot live to ſin any longer; as a graft cut off the old ſtock, lives not in the ſtock any longer, but wholly lives in another; ſo that man that is united to Chriſt, being cut off from the old ſtock, lives not to corrupt nature any longer; Nay, there is nothing now ſo contrary to the life of a Chriſtian as ſin, nothing ſo hateful; nothing was more hateful to Chriſt; he came into the world to deſtroy the works of the devil, to deſtroy ſin;<note place="margin">1 John 3.8. Rom. 6.6. 1 Pet. 4.1, 2.</note> and they that are in Chriſt, their old man was crucified with him; and thus, he that hath ſuffered in the fleſh, hath ceaſed from ſin, <hi>i. e.</hi> he that hath been crucified with Chriſt, ſin reignes no more in his heart; ſo then <hi>they that are Chriſts have crucified the fleſh,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 5.24.</note> 
               <hi>with the affections and luſts thereof;</hi> they cannot cleave in their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons unto ſin, nay, they cannot but hate it, as being that that
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:118254:27"/> drew tears and blood from Chriſts heart, who is now dearer to them then their own lives. Therefore ſuch as can give up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the love of any one ſin, and ſuffer their affection to be inſnared with the love of it, were never united truly to Chriſt; for ſeparation from ſin, and union to Chriſt, are inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable companions. Thus you ſee how we may know our uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Chriſt.</p>
            <p>The laſt Uſe ſhall be to perſwade every man to labour after this union, ſeeing life and death ſtands in it. Chriſt himſelf will profit us nothing without this union. Wealth in the Mine doth not inrich any man till it be ſevered from its droſſe, and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated to a particular uſe; water in the Fountain profits not a man, till it be conveighed by ſome pipe into his ciſterne; light in the Sun doth me no good, unleſſe I have an eye to behold it; Chriſt is a rich Mine, in which are hid unſearchable treaſures, but what am I the better if he be not mine? <hi>Tolle meum &amp; tolle Deum,</hi> ſaith <hi>Luther;</hi> Take away my propriety in Chriſt, and the knowledge of a Chriſt will torment, and not comfort my heart. He is a Fountain of living water, but unleſſe faith be the conduit-pipe, and cock to conveigh this water, I may periſh for all that; he is a Sun of righteouſneſſe, yet if he do not enlighten me, I may be caſt into utter darkneſſe; therefore till Chriſt by ſome bond or union become mine and I his, I may be as miſerable as if this Mine had not been diſcovered, as if this Fountain had not been opened, as if this Sun had never riſen. Now this uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and communion with Chriſt on our part is by faith; Oh let us labour for faith.</p>
            <p>Conſider how freely God hath given Chriſt for us, and how willing God is to give Chriſt to us; conſider how lovingly Chriſt invites us to come, and how willingly he will imbrace every ſoul that comes;<note place="margin">John 6.38.</note> 
               <hi>For this is the will of the Father, that whoſoever come, he ſhould in no wiſe caſt out, The Spirit ſaith, come,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 22.17.</note> 
               <hi>and the Bride ſaith, come; Whoſoever will let him come, and drinke of the water of life freely.</hi> And to that end that faith may be wrought, attend upon the Word of God, <hi>for faith cometh by hearing, it is the power of God to ſalvation;</hi> and deſire the Lord to draw thee unto Chriſt, tell him thou art undone with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chriſt, and there is nothing that thy heart is more ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on then Chriſt; and if he will give thee Chriſt, thou wilt
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:118254:27"/> be conntented whatever he do with thee; and when the Lord ſeeth thee hunger and thirſt after Chriſt and his righteouſneſſe, and that nothing but a Chriſt will content thee; he will ſay, <hi>Be it unto thee according to thy deſire;</hi> if nothing but a Chriſt will ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie thee, why, take Chriſt, and let him everlaſtingly become thine, and with his Chriſt he will give his Spirit, if thou aske it, to ſeal up this gift to thy heart to thy everlaſting comfort.</p>
            <p>Thus then being come to the end of this Sermon, as it was delivered, with as little variation as I could, I ſhall proſecute this argument no further; and if friends and enemies would have been ſo ſatisfied, I had not troubled the Preſſe with this Sermon, but I and it had been yet buried in ſilence; but ſince it is the will of God, I here ſubmit it to the judgement of my Brethren; and I doubt not but I ſhall receive from them a <hi>qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etus eſt,</hi> to diſcharge me from Mr <hi>Eyre</hi>'s Arreſt, who hath in the Pulpit and Preſſe condemned this Sermon, as wide from the Orthodox Faith; which if he will undertake to ſhew, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince me wherein, I promiſe him through the grace of Chriſt to be a thankful Proſelyte.</p>

               <p>To which I anſwer, that as he hath a faculty to ſpeak of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers what they never ſaid, ſo he can hear what they never ſpake; he hath innovated my tearmes, of which as in our conference, (ſo in his Printed relation, where he is no leſſe peccant,) he was always wittingly, (as I conceive) guilty, which becauſe I minded him of before the people; he ſtiles in his Book a provocation of language which I gave him.</p>
               <p>But to the matter, becauſe I intend not a ſtrife of words, I ſhall firſt readily grant him, that the Elect were given to Chriſt by the Father before the foundations of the world, and Chriſt to them; if he underſtand it onely of an immanent act terminated in God himſelf, and underſtand by it no more then an eternall purpoſe in God, to give Chriſt in the fulneſſe of time to die for thoſe whom in his eternal counſel he had fore-ordained to eternal life, and to give them faith whereby they may become his members; but if he judge this to be actually done, and that Chriſt and all the Elect were one myſtical bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and ſo juſtified from eternity, I wholly diſſent from him; Predeſtination is only a love of purpoſe and intention, not of execution; it being an immanent act, leaveth no poſitive reall effect upon the perſon predeſtinated. Hence when God
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:118254:29" rendition="simple:additions"/> is ſaid to give Chriſt to the Elect from eternity, it ſignifies only the will and purpoſe of God, conſtituting and appointing Chriſt to die for the Elect, (but he was not actually given till in the fulneſſe of time he ſent him into the world; and although in his death he gave him to die for them, yet was he not actually given to them, that they ſhould poſſeſſe the benefits of his death until actuall faith; and I ſhall further manifeſt this, when I ſhall prove that an immanent act of God purpoſing to juſtifie us, is not our formal juſtification.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Whereas he ſaith, that Chriſt gave himſelf a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a ſweet ſmelling ſavour, and bare our ſins in his body on the tree, even to a ful propitiation:</hi> This I willingly acknowledge, and bleſſe the Lord for; if he underſtand it only of the fulneſs of ſatisfaction, and not of an immediate diſcharge of the ſinner for whom he died; Chriſt did not ſatisfie the juſtice of God by divine acceptation, but he ſatisfied the juſtice of God fully; the dignity and excellency of his perſon did no way diſpenſe with any degree of the extremity of the puniſhment due to our ſin, (which was conſiſtent with his Godhead and holyneſſe to ſuffer) but it was to make the ſufferings of one available for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. And <hi>Scotus</hi> gives a conſiderable reaſon for it, <hi>quia poenâ ab unà eximere Chriſtum ſi valuiſſet, valuiſſet etiam ex duabus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Scotus <hi>in quar.</hi> Sentent. diſt. 46. Q. 4. Art. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>atque ita ex omnibus eum emancipare.</hi> And I acknowledge there was not a deficiency, but a redundancy of merit in his ſufferings; the juſtice of God cannot require any thing more at the hands of Chriſt our ſurety, or of the ſinner by way of ſatisfaction, and in this ſenſe he is well pleaſed with Chriſt as a publick perſon; but if by a full propitiation he underſtand an immediate diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of the ſinner from condemnation before faith, to apply the benefits of Chriſts death; this I deny, and will make manifeſt in its peculiar and proper place; Where I ſhall ſhew it is no wrong either to Chriſt, or the Elect perſon, that the benefit of Chriſts death is ſuſpended till faith. And in this ſenſe I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that the Elect had no actual right, or intereſt in Chriſt, if you take it for <hi>jus in re,</hi> and not for <hi>jus adrem,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his death was intended for their benefit; not for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate, though they have not actual benefit, and poſſeſſion of the good things purchaſed untill faith. In reſpect of Gods, and Chriſts intention in his death, ſurely an Elect perſon hath more
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:118254:30"/> right to the benefits of Chriſts death then the reprobate, it being intended effectually for <hi>Peter</hi> and not for <hi>Judas;</hi> and by vertue of this, faith ſhall be given to apply it to all for whom Chriſt died, and ſo they have a right to the thing; but in reſpect of any right in the thing it ſelf, or actual diſcharge of the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, I acknowledge in this reſpect, there is no preſent dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the Elect and reprobate; this is that which ſoundeth ſo harſh in Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi>'s eare, which I ſhall ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cleare when I produce in its due place Scripture-authority, and Arguments to confirme it.</p>
               <p>I ſhall now onely vindicate it from thoſe monſtrous abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that he unjuſtly loades it with.</p>
               <p>Firſt, he ſaith, <hi>Nothing could be ſpoken more contradictory to plain Scriptures;</hi> but produceth not one place to confirme it, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferres us to ſuch Scriptures as he forceth to ſpeak in defence of his own opinion, where we ſhall examine whether what we affirme or he maintaines, be moſt agreeable to the truth; on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I ſhall inſtance in two Scriptures to relieve this truth.</p>
               <p>The firſt is in <hi>Epheſians</hi> 2.1, 2, 3. where the Apoſtle tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the Elect <hi>Epheſians,</hi> whom God had ordained to life, and for whom Chriſt died, that they <hi>were dead in ſins and treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes; Wherein they walked according to the courſe of this world, according to the prince of the power of the aire, the ſpirit that now worketh in the children of diſobedience;</hi> into which number in the third <hi>ver.</hi> he puts himſelf and all believers before their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and ſaith, <hi>that they were children of wrath by nature, as well as others;</hi> where the Apoſtles ſcope is to ſhew the freeneſſe of Gods grace in ſaving them by faith in Chriſt, by an argument drawn from the change of their eſtate; he telleth them the time was they <hi>were children of wrath,</hi> as unable to help themſelves, as the dead to raiſe themſelves to life, therefore their deliverance was by grace. Where by children of wrath, the Apoſtle muſt mean an eſtate and condition oppoſite to their preſent eſtate of ſalvation, and juſtification, into which they are now brought by the grace of God, and merit of Chriſt by faith.</p>
               <p>Elſe firſt the <hi>Apostles Argument</hi> from the change of their eſtate were invalid. Now if they would know when they were children of wrath, ſeeing God loved them as elect from eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and they were redeemed by Chriſt; He anſwers, that it was
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:118254:30"/> when they <hi>were dead in ſins and treſpaſſes, and walked according to the courſe of this world, according to the prince of the power of the aire, the ſpirit that now worketh in the children of diſobedience,</hi> and then they were children of wrath; but thus they did walk and live before faith and regeneration were wrought.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Such an eſtate of condemnation is here meant, as others are in that are the men of this world, <hi>children of diſobedience,</hi>

               <p n="3">3. If it be ſuch an eſtate wherein they <hi>were dead in ſins and treſpaſſes,</hi> did walk <hi>according to the prince of this world,</hi> and <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the prince of the power of the aire, the ſpirit that now ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually worketh in the children of diſobedience,</hi> having <hi>their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation in the luſts of the fleſh, fulfilling the deſires of the fleſh;</hi> ſurely this was inconſiſtent with ſalvation, and the eſtate of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification; God cannot juſtifie a man with imputed righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but at the ſame time he ſanctifieth him by imparted,<note place="margin">Prov. 17.15.</note> and inherent righteouſneſſe: It is not agreeable to the purity and holineſſe of Gods nature to juſtifie a wicked man; for <hi>He that juſtifieth the wicked, &amp; be that condemneth the juſt: even they both are abomination to the Lord;</hi> and what God condemnes in others, he will not do himſelf, therefore they were not then juſtified. Nor doth the Apoſtle make a naked compariſon between the two e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates and conditions derived from the firſt and ſecond <hi>Adam;</hi> but compares the ſame perſons not barely in relation to theſe, but as being really in both theſe eſtates, at a different time; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the firſt before converſion, and paſſing from it upon believing, where it is obſerveable, that the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> doth not ſay, ye <hi>are</hi> by nature children of wrath, which is all Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> will acknowledge, as you may ſee, <hi>pag.</hi> 111. but ye <hi>were</hi> children of wrath; he ſpeaks of a condition they were in, and delivered from.</p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:118254:31"/>
               <p>The ſecond Scripture is in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9, 10, 11. <hi>Know ye not that the unrighteous ſhall not inherit the Kingdome of God? Be not deceived, neither fornicatours, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abuſers of themſelves with mankinde, nor thieves ſhall inherit the Kingdome of God; ſuch were ſome of you, but you are waſhed, but you are juſtified in the Name of the Lord Jeſus.</hi> Where you ſee the Elect <hi>Corinthians</hi> were while unſanctified, ſuch as could not inherit the Kingdome of God, and therefore were in the ſame eſtate with other perſons till they were waſhed and juſtified; where he maketh an evident oppoſition between the time paſt and preſent, they were then ſuch as could not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit eternal life, and therefore were juſtified; for if they were then juſtified, what could hinder their ſalvation? And he ſaith, but you <hi>are</hi> juſtified; he doth not ſay, but you <hi>were</hi> juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, reſtraining their juſtification to the time preſent upon their faith, and ſanctification being an evidence of the truth of that faith, that makes him put their ſanctification before their juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication; ſo that you ſee the Apoſtle affirmes while they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanctified, they could not inherit the Kingdome of God; that is, they had no right to it by juſtification, and were uncapable of it; but upon the change of their eſtate by faith, they were juſtified by Chriſt, of which change in the judgement of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity he concludes, by their ſanctification: Now what can be ſpoken more fully to clear this matter in controverſie, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore faith and effectuall vocation, they are no more freed from condemnation then others?</p>
               <p n="2">2. He ſaith, <hi>It is wide from the Orthodox Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which I anſwer, firſt by retortion, that then he himſelf is wide from the Orthodox faith; becauſe, <hi>pag.</hi> 66. he ſaith the ſame thing in different termes,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mr.</hi> Eyre <hi>vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dic.</hi> pag. 66. Num. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>[Though the ſtate of the loved and hated are different in the minde of God, yet not in the perſons them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, till the different effects of love and hatred are put forth.</hi>

               <p>Now an immanent act of Gods minde puts no preſent differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; for, <hi>Praedeſtinatio nihil ponit in praedestinato,</hi> is a known rule.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It hath hitherto been the unanimous conſent of the Orthodox, that there is no difference between the Elect and reprobate, as to preſent enjoyment, untill actual faith; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they hold in this reſpect a difference, which I never queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned;
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:118254:31"/> that although they be equally in a ſtate of ſin and wrath, yet God hath a purpoſe to bring the Elect infallibly out of that miſery; and to leave the reprobate,<note place="margin">Rom. 9.13.</note> in which reſpect God is ſaid to love <hi>Jacob,</hi> and to hate <hi>Eſau;</hi> and in this reſpect,<note place="margin">Acts 13.48.</note> all that God hath ordained to life, ſhall believe; and whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Father giveth unto Chriſt, they ſhall come; for,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2.19.</note> 
                  <hi>The foundation of God ſtandeth ſure, the Lord knoweth who are his;</hi> but on the other hand, for the preſent there is no difference; both are children of wrath, both are without Chriſt, both aliens to the Covenant of Grace, having no promiſe of the pardon of ſin, both without hope in the world, only Gods purpoſe will in time make an actuall difference between them; ſo Mr. <hi>Burgeſſe</hi> of <hi>Juſtifica.</hi> p. 188.<note place="margin">Burgeſſ. <hi>of</hi> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtific. <hi>p.</hi> 188.</note> but you are prejudicated againſt him; I will propound three others of unqueſtionable authority; Holy and Learned Mr. <hi>Baines</hi> in his Commentary upon <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.3. drawes this obſervation from it.</p>

               <p n="1">1. That the mercy of God may be magnified, and made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt in the free grace of Juſtification.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That love may be engendred in us, being juſtified; <hi>Mary</hi> who had many ſins forgiven, loved much; ſo that eminent ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of Chriſt, Dr. <hi>Tayl.</hi> in his <hi>Commen.</hi> upon <hi>Titus,</hi> ch. 3. v. 3.<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Tayl.</hi> Tit. c. 3. v. 3. p. 591.</note> pag. 591. Whoſoever are called unto the faith, have experience of a double eſtate in themſelves; once in time paſt, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the preſent; the one of nature, the other of grace. And a little after: And good reaſon there is, that he that is now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, ſhould ſee that once he was not beloved; and that he who now is in the ſtate of grace, ſhould ſee that he was once in the ſtate of wrath as well as others, which will cauſe him to love much: And indeed the Elect could not be Elect, nor juſtified, nor waſhed, if they were alwayes the children of God; and were it not for this once, and time paſt, wherein there was no difference between them and the reprobate, but only in Gods
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:118254:32"/> counſel and poſſibility of calling. Learned <hi>Camero</hi> ſetteth to his ſeal to this truth; <hi>Ad</hi> Petrum <hi>in peccatis mortuum non magis pertinet Chriſti mors quàm ad alium quemvis, ſed poſtquam</hi> Petro <hi>datum est credere eſt diſcrimen ſanè magnum.</hi> Camero, <hi>opuſc. miſc. p.</hi> 534. And that he was no Arminian, is evident by what he ſaith in another place: <hi>Rectiùs faciunt qui Chriſtum pro impiis ſufficienter (ut loquntur) ſatisfeciſſe docent, efficaciter au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem pro ſolis piis.</hi> Cam. <hi>opuſc. miſc. p.</hi> 534. <hi>Sect.</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, he objecteth that it is derogatory to the full atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made by Chriſts death; If this could be proved, there need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no further argument to ſilence me; yea, it were better my tongue ſhould cleave to the roof of my mouth, then that I ſhould affirme any thing to abaſe the worth, or diminiſh the reputation of Chriſts ſufferings; he deſerves not to open his mouth to God for mercy, that willingly opens his mouth to undervalue the merits and ſatisfaction made by the death of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>I therefore anſwer, that if Chriſt had died to purchaſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſe of ſins whether we believe or not, this argument would have ſome ſtrength in it, then to ſuſpend the benefit of Chriſts death untill faith, were to wrong the ſatisfaction of Chriſt; but Chriſt did not ſo die for the Elect, that whether they believe or not believe, they ſhould be ſaved; therefore to ſuſpend the benefit of Chriſts death till actual faith, is no wrong to the atonement and ſatisfaction made by Chriſts death.</p>
               <p>Now becauſe this is the maine argument to which Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> truſts, and is the onely pillar and ſupport of his opinion, <hi>That it was the will of God that the death of Chriſt ſhould be the payment of our debt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mr. EYRE, p. 138, 139.</note> 
                  <hi>and a full ſatisfaction for all our iniquities; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was his will that our diſcharge procured hereby, ſhould be immediate, becauſe he ſaith it's contrary to juſtice and equity, that a debt when it is paid, ſhould be charged either upon the ſurety, or principal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will here lay down ſundry concluſions, which may ſerve to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate our doctrine, that the benefit of Chriſts death is ſuſpended untill faith, as to a formall juſtification of the ſinner, and ſhew the inſufficiency and weakneſſe of his argument; from hence to conclude an immediate diſcharge of all the Elect from the time
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:118254:32"/> of Chriſts death, antecedent to their faith.</p>
               <p>Firſt, therefore I willingly acknowlege that Chriſt in his death was a common perſon, and a ſurety for the Elect, taking upon himſelf by Gods eternal appointment this work of redemption and reconciliation. That the act of Gods Ordination, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a particular command from the Father to lay down his life,<note place="margin">John 10.18.</note> and his voluntary conſent and ſubmiſſion to become a ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for the Elect,<note place="margin">Heb. 10.7, 9.</note> (for it was not impoſed upon him by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, therefore when he is ſaid to come to do his Fathers will, his own will is included;<note place="margin">John 10.18.</note> 
                  <hi>And no man took away his life from him, but he did lay it down of himſelf;</hi>) this act of Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in God, and ſubmiſſion in Chriſt, together with his free dominion over his own life, (which dominion he had, both by vertue of the hypoſtatical union, and the command of the Father to lay it down,) accompanied with ſufficient power to break through the ſufferings he undertook, and to raiſe up himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; all this conſtituted Chriſt God-man, being perfectly righteous, a fit perſon to become a ſurety; and now it was juſt and righteous, that Chriſt an innocent perſon ſhould be charged with the ſins of the Elect.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I grant that no creature that was only a creature, whether Angel or man could or ought to undertake this work.</p>
               <p n="1">1. No Angel ought, becauſe Gods juſtice required that ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction ſhould be given by the ſame nature that had ſinne;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bernard</hi> de paſſ. Dom. 1. <hi>Cap.</hi> 46.</note> nor was it meet he ſhould be man only, that our redemption and ſalvation might be attributed to none but him from whom we had our creation, for that reaſon which <hi>Bernard</hi> alledgeth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe our redemption would more oblidge us to love, then our creation; if therefore we had been redeemed by any other then him by whom we were made, we ſhould have loved him more then our Creatour. Neither could any pure creature be fitly qualified for this work; for whatever the creature can do, is already <hi>debitum,</hi> a due debt, and therefore it cannot ſupper-ero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, or merit any thing for us.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I grant therefore that Chriſt was God and Man, and that it was needful he ſhould be both.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He muſt be God that muſt ſatisfie God; for God was
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:118254:33"/> offended; and therefore to make ſatisfaction, God in our nature ſatisfieth for our ſin: So that here is God, ſatisfying God; that if the ſin be infinite in the object, the ſatisfaction is infinite in reſpect of the ſubject ſuffering, God in our nature; and although his ſufferings were not infinite in duration, (nor was there need they ſhould be, becauſe he ſatisfied for ſuch ſins as ſhould be broken off by repentance; And his end was in ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering to ſatisfie, therefore his ſufferings muſt have an end,) yet his ſufferings were unmeaſurably great; and what was wanting in the ſhortneſſe, was made up in the ſharpneſſe of the ſufferings, and it was impoſſible Chriſt ſhould be held under the ſorrows of death; the duration of the priſoner in the Jayle is no part of the debt, but accidentall to it, he lies there but till the debt be paid; Now Chriſt paid all, ſo as fully to ſatisfie the juſtice of God; and hence there was no need of his eternal ſuffering. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, it was needful he ſhould be God, that his obedience might be perfect, and meritorious, to dignifie his obedience, and make it of infinite value, that he might merit and ſupport himſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his ſuffering, and raiſe up himſelf again, and performe the reſt of the works of the Mediatourſhip.</p>
               <p>And it was needful he ſhould be Man; for as he was God he could not ſuffer; and that he might, as juſtice requireth, ſatisfie in our nature, that our pardon might not be an act of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion only, and forgiveneſſe, but an act of juſtice and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, I willingly grant that Chriſt did ſuffer whatſoever ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaines to the ſubſtance and eſſentials of the firſt death, or the death naturall, conſiſting in the ſeparation of ſoul and body; and though the curſe doth not require any one particular death, yet that the Lord might ſhew the hainouſneſſe of ſin, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves the worſt death of all, and that the love of Chriſt might be manifeſted, and Gods juſtice declared; God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther appointed it, and Chriſt undertook it, to die the death of the Croſſe, a ſhameful and baſe death, appropriated to the worſt of malefactors,<note place="margin">Phil. 2.6, 8.</note> to ſhew the hatefulneſſe of ſin, and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Chriſts humiliation, and love in ſubmitting to it; he humbled himſelf to the death of the Croſſe.</p>

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:118254:34"/> Apoſtle calls them <hi>children of wrath as well as others.</hi> Man being created after Gods own Image, free from ſin before the fall, was intimately conjoyned to God; God loving and delighting in man, and man loving and delighting in his God; but man lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by voluntary Apoſtaſie from God, there is an avulſion of the creature from God, and an averſion of God from the creature; and by this ſin, the Covenant of friendſhip between God and man is diſſolved; ſo that God who loved man, created by him as his childe, and from eternity willing him good, (for I ſpeak only of the Elect) in juſtice cannot but hate him now, as corrupted by ſin, as a rebell againſt him; not by any change of affection, but of his outward diſpenſation; and having inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him under guilt as a ſon of <hi>Adam,</hi> he is equally involved in the wrath due to that ſin, which God hath threatened with eternal death, and reſolved by an immutable decree, never to pardon it to any without a ſatisfaction to his offended juſtice for the breach of his Law, that the truth of his threatning may be fulfilled, and the authority of his Law preſerved, and the evil of ſin diſcovered, and Gods exceeding love and mercy in a way mixt with mercy, and juſtice may be manifeſted in the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of his Elect: So that although there be a new relation in the Elect upon their fall in <hi>Adam</hi> unto God; yet the change is in the creature, and not in God; for as the Schoolmen well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, theſe relations which are attributed unto God in time, as a Creatour, Father or Lord, put not any new thing in God; but there is an extrinſecal denomination added to him; ſo that when the world is created, God who was not a Creatour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, is now a Creatour; thus when ſin took hold of the Elect, he that once was a childe of love, is now a childe of wrath, not by any new accident in God, but by a new effect in the creature; ſo that in this eſtate, God cannot beſtow upon him the good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in election.</p>
               <p>For the better underſtanding of this, that of <hi>Aquinas</hi> is of great uſe; God may <hi>velle mutationem,</hi> where he cannot <hi>mutare volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem;</hi> God may will a change, though he doth not change his will: Thus in <hi>Adam,</hi> while he continued a man after Gods I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, free from ſin, God willed him to be the object of his love and delight; and when he was fallen, to be the ſubject of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:118254:35"/> his diſpleaſure and anger, in the effects of it, being liable unto his wrath, and eternall death; yet is not here a change in God, but in <hi>Adam:</hi> Thus God with the ſame will decreed from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, to make ſuch a one a veſſel of mercy, and yet to permit him to ſin, and fall in <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſo to remaine a childe of wrath, deſerving condemnation, wherein God cannot actually ſave him, (conſidering his decree,) without a ſatisfaction by Chriſt applied by faith. Here is a change, and a very great one in man, but not in God; a new relation, yet no new immanent act in God. Thus we may underſtand that of venerable <hi>Beda</hi> in the 5.<note place="margin">Beda <hi>in</hi> Rom. 5.</note>

               <p>Hence then we ſee, that there is a reconciliation wrought by the death of Chriſt, which imports not a change in Gods will, as if God did then firſt begin to love, or will well unto us, as if he did hate, and will to damne us before; for then we muſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of a proper change in the will of God, proceeding from an external cauſe, which is contrary to Scripture, and ſound reaſon: for as <hi>Rutherford</hi> hath well obſerved:<note place="margin">Ruth. <hi>Apollex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ere.</hi> p 37.</note>

               </p>
               <p>But whereas we lay under wrath deſerved by ſin, Chriſt hath cauſatively removed by his death the guilt of ſin, and ſo meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly reconciled us to God; ſo that God is not only now <hi>placabilis</hi> by the death of Chriſt, but <hi>placatus;</hi> for he was <hi>pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cabilis</hi> from eternity, or elſe he had never given Chriſt; but now in reſpect of the ſatisfaction given, he is <hi>placatus</hi> thus far, that we lie no more, (that are the Elect) under an indiſpenſable neceſſity of periſhing, which we did before till ſatisfaction given; and this is the formal effect of Chriſts death, and this act of reconciliation, which is a tranſient act done in time, compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not the action of Election, as <hi>Wallaeus</hi> ſeemes to affirme,<note place="margin">Wallaerus <hi>Cont; Corvinum,</hi> c. 25. p. 155.</note> and ſuperaddes no new thing in Gods will, which was not there before; but it removes cauſatively, and meritoriouſly, that that was the cauſe of enmity, which hindred God from being able accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to juſtice (ſuppoſing his Decree) to beſtow the good

               <p>Seventhly, That this reconciliation wrought by Chriſt, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of guilt, cauſatively by his death and ſatisfaction, is not properly, and formally our juſtification: I therefore affirme with Mr <hi>Rutherford,</hi>

                     <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> is given indeed by Chriſt on the Croſſe for all our ſins before we do believe, and before any juſtified perſon, who lived theſe fifteen hundred years be borne; but alas, that is not juſtification, but only the meritorious cauſe of it; <hi>and a little after,</hi> Juſtification is a forenſical ſentence, in time pronounced in the Goſpel, and applied unto me now; and never while this inſtant now, that I believe.</q>

               <p>Now for the further clearing and evidencing this truth, that we are not actually juſtified untill faith:<note place="margin">Joh. 3.15, 16. Mark 16.16. Acts 13.38, 39. Acts 16.31. Rom. 10.2. Phil. 3.9.</note> I ſhall lay down ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry Propoſitions to make this manifeſt, and that it is no wrong either to Chriſt, or the Elect, that this benefit is ſuſpended until faith, beſides the clear light of the Scripture, as you may ſee in the Margin.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Therefore there is a twofold payment of a debt, one of the thing altogether the ſame, which was in the Obligation; another of a thing not altogether the ſame. That payment which is of the ſame thing, either by our ſelves, or our ſurety, is not refuſable by the Creditour; ſo that if we had paid it, or Chriſt
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:118254:36"/> had been conſtituted a ſurety by us to pay it, then God could not have refuſed it. And therefore Chriſt being conſtituted a ſurety by God, and not by us, and paying not altogether the ſame, God might have refuſed the payment, and therefore may alſo appoint how, in what order and time it ſhall be accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whether to a preſent diſcharge, or upon a future condition of faith to be performed by us, by the help of his Spirit work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this in us. 'Tis true, that Chriſt being admitted by the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor, and taken into bond with us, God cannot refuſe to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of Chriſts death as a ſatisfaction; yet he might appoint, as you ſhall ſee he did, how it ſhall be accepted, whether abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, or upon ſome condition afterward to be performed by us. Here are three things then to be explained and proved:
<list>
                     <item>1. That the ſufferings of Chriſt were not altogether the ſame in the Obligation.</item>
                     <item>2. That therefore 'tis in the power of the Creditour (at whoſe liberty and mercy it is to accept, or refuſe it, antecedently before his acceptation,) to appoint or ordain it to be immediately a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailable, or to be acceptable upon condition.</item>
                     <item>3. That it was agreed upon between the Father and Son, that it ſhould not be available to diſcharge the ſinner until actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all faith.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1 Therefore I grant, which Mr <hi>Eyre</hi> alledgeth out of Mr. <hi>Owen,</hi> that if he ſpeak in reſpect of the ſubſtance of Chriſts ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, there was a ſameneſſe with that in the Obligation in reſpect of Eſſence, and equivalency in reſpect of the adjuncts or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendencies; yea, a ſupereminency of ſatisfaction and redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancy of merit; yet was it not altogether the ſame in the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation.</p>
               <p>For firſt, the Law in the rigour of it doth not admit of a ſurety, but the delinquent himſelf is bound to ſuffer the penalty, that acknowledgeth no commutation of the perſon, or ſubſtitution of one for another; and therefore God by an act of Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty did diſpenſe, though not with the ſubſtance of the Laws de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands; (for then we had had forgiveneſſe without a ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and conſidering his decree, he could not do it,) but with the manner of execution, which in reſpect of the Law is called a relaxation; ſo then God relaxed his Law, to put in the name of a ſurety, therefore the ſatisfaction is not altogether the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:118254:37"/> of the ſame debt; for <hi>Dum alius ſolvit, neceſſariò aliud ſolvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur;</hi> and therefore an act of grace muſt come in by the will and conſent of the Lord to whom belonged the infliction of the puniſhment, that another perſons ſufferings may be valid to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a diſcharge to the guilty perſon, and that the ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was made by another, and not by the party to whom remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is granted, no Proteſtant will deny.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Chriſt did not bear the ſame puniſhment due to us in all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In reſpect of place, he did not locally diſcend into the place of the damned. Nor,</p>
               <p n="2">2. In reſpect of time and duration, his ſufferings had an end; though they were infinite <hi>intenſivè,</hi> yet not <hi>extenſivè?</hi> in reſpect of duration, nor did he ſuffer the loſſe of Gods Image, nor was he deprived of any meaſure of grace, nor was he really (but as to preſent ſenſe and feeling) forſaken, nor did he loſe his right to the creatures, nor did his body ſee corruption; all which are effects of mans ſin, and penal effects of it, as I appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend. Therefore Chriſt did not ſuffer altogether the ſame, though the ſufferings of Chriſt ſo farre as were conſiſtent with his Godhead and holineſſe, were of the ſame kinde; and by the dignity of his perſon, raiſed to a more then equipollency with ours, ſo as to merit for us eternal life. <hi>Quid enim Majeſtas tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta, par ipſi Patri, poenis ſuis non commeribitur</hi>

               <p n="3">3. Though Chriſt were obliged to the ſame puniſhment, yet not altogether with the ſame obligation; for his Obligation was arbitrary and voluntary; not ariſing from the guilt of inherent ſin, but by way of vadimony, and ſuc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ption; our guilt or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation was intrinſecally from the deſert of inherent ſin; Chriſt's was only an obnoxiouſneſſe unto puniſhment from the imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſin, ours from a deſert of ſin, called <hi>reatus culpae;</hi> which guilt is inſeparable from ſinne, which draweth <hi>reatus poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> along with it, Chriſt was <hi>reatus poenae,</hi> not <hi>culpae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Chriſts ſufferings was to be a valuable compenſation, not only for our breach of the Law, but for our non-ſuffering, and therefore is not altogether the ſame.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing to be cleared, is this, that it being not the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:118254:37"/> ſame, therefore it requires ſome act of grace in the Creditour to accept it for a diſcharge unto the guilty perſon (and herein undoubtedly the ſinner hath no wrong, for it is mercy in God to accept it; the Law requires his perſonal ſufferings, and there is no promiſe made to any, that they ſhall have benefit by Chriſts death, but only to Believers.)</p>
               <p>And this cannot be denied with any ſhew of reaſon, for ſuch a payment is refuſable, which is not altogether the ſame; and therefore unleſſe the will and conſent of him to whom the infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the puniſhment belongeth, it cannot procure a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge to the guilty perſon; for the offending ſinner is the proper ſubject of ſuffering, and the Law threatneth the offender, and the ſurety is not the offender; and none but he that had power to make the Law, can diſpenſe with any thing in the Law; therefore that the Law may be diſpenſed with, in reſpect of the manner of execution, by transferring the puniſhment upon another, and that this may be accepted as a full ſatisfaction for the offender, as if he had in perſon ſuffered, this muſt be an act of grace in the Law-giver, receding from his own right; and therefore might conſtitute and ordain, how and in what manner it ſhall be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, and none that I know will deny it an act of ſpeciall grace in God to accept of the ſufferings of Chriſt for us, to free us from our perſonal ſufferings; and therefore I paſſe from that unto the third thing.</p>
               <p n="3">3dly, That it was the will of Chriſt in making ſatisfaction, and of God in admitting of this ſatisfaction, that it ſhould not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure pardon of ſin preſently from the time of Chriſts paſſion; but when man is turned unto God by faith, ſeeking and humbly intreating for pardon. Now to manifeſt this, we muſt premiſe:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That it was an act of ſpecial grace, not only to us, but to Chriſt himſelf, that ſhould be conſtituted a Mediatour of a New Covenant between God and us, by vertue of whoſe media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſufferings we ſhould be forgiven, and made heirs of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall life; Chriſt as he is the ſecond perſon in the Trinity, in reſpect of his Godhead, is equall with the Father, and ſo not ſubject to any preordination, or predeſtination as an act of
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:118254:38"/> grace; but Chriſt conſidered as God-man in reſpect of his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatorſhip, is a ſervant of God, and ſo ſubject to Predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and Gods ſingular grace in his Election to this office, is as much ſeen as in our Election unto life; for the manhood could never deſerve to be united perſonally to the Sonne of God; and thus it was a great honour put upon Chriſt,<note place="margin">Heb. 5 5.</note> when he was put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Prieſtly Office to make atonement for us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It was at the commandment of grace he made ſatisfaction, it was an act of free grace to us, and Chriſt as Mediator was a ſervant of God,<note place="margin">Iſa. 42.1. John 10.18.</note> and wholly at the will of the Lord in this work; at his commandment he laid down his life, and at his will and pleaſure the benefit of his death is extended to particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and denied to others; therefore Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Power is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him over all fleſh,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John 17.2.</note> 
                  <hi>to give eternal life</hi> (but it is with reſtricti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) <hi>only to as many as the Father had given him.</hi> Now the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of Chriſt were of ſufficient value to redeem the whole world; but yet it is available by Gods eternal will only for the Elect; and if it be no wrong to the ſufferings of Chriſt to be limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the will of God to the Elect only, and Chriſt ſubmitteth to it, why ſhould it be thought any injury to Chriſts ſufferings, that at the will and pleaſure of God the very Elect ſhould not partake of it untill faith, in that order that he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed?</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is an act of grace that the ſufferings of Chriſt, though in themſelves they be adequately proportionable to the juſtice of God, ſhould be accepted for us; therefore God may at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure appoint the manner how, whether abſolutely and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, or upon a future condition? For, as <hi>Scotus</hi> ſaith well, <hi>Meritum Chriſti tantum bonum eſt nobis,</hi>

                  <hi>pro quanto acceptabatur à Deo:</hi> The value of Chriſts merits is to be accounted to us, only ſo farre as God accepteth it; and therefore to that which Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> and his adherents urge, that ſatisfaction was given, and accepted.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, by diſtinguiſhing upon acceptance; This may be taken in a two fold ſenſe, either in reſpect of the ſurety Chriſt, and the price paid; or in reſpect to the ſinner, and the actuall application of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In reſpect to Chriſt, and the value of his ſufferings, it
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:118254:38"/> was a full ſatisfaction, that God neither can (having admitted Chriſt a ſurety) require more at the hands of Chriſt, nor any thing elſe of the ſinner by way of ſatisfaction to his juſtice; but he never accepted it in reſpect of the ſinner to effect his freedome and preſent diſcharge, without ſome act of his intervening to give him intereſt in this ſatisfaction. Nor do I judge faith to be a moving cauſe, or organical inſtrument either of Chriſts ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or of Gods acceptation of it for us; Faith doth not make Chriſts ſatisfaction to be meritorious; Faith is not the condition of Chriſts acquiring pardon, but of the application of pardon; the dignity and worth of Chriſts merits and ſatisfaction, ariſe from the dignity of his perſon; nor is faith the moving cauſe of Gods will to accept of Chriſts ſatisfaction for us, that ariſeth from Gods will of purpoſe ordaining it for us.

               </p>
               <p n="4">4. It is of great conſequence toward the clearing of this, that the death of Chriſt doth not procure an immediate diſcharge to the ſinner, to conſider that the death of Chriſt is not a naturall and phyſical cauſe of removing and taking away ſin; for then the effect muſt immediately follow; but it is a meritorious cauſe, which is in the number of morall cauſes; and here the rule is not true, <hi>Poſitâ cauſâ ponitur effectus;</hi> for here the effect is at the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the perſons moved thereby: and hence ſometime the effects of morall cauſes precede the cauſe, as for the death of Chriſt God pardoned the ſins of ſuch as died in the faith long before Chriſt was borne; and ſometime it followes a long time after, at the agreement and liberty of the perſons that are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded thereby to do any thing.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Chriſt by his death did not abſolutely purchaſe reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and an actual diſcharge from the guilt of ſin for any, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they believe or not believe; for then faith were not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to ſalvation; but at the moſt, to conſolation; and finall unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief would condemne none of thoſe for whom Chriſt died; but the Scripture ſaith, <hi>He that believeth not, ſhall be damned;</hi> and,<note place="margin">Mark. 16.16.

               <p n="1">1. As it is oppoſed to an antecedent condition to be brought by us by the power of our own free-will, ſo that upon this ſhall depend the fruits of Chriſts death. Or,</p>

Abſolutely may be taken as oppoſed to any prerequiſite condition ordained by God as a certain order and meanes to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the fruit of Chriſts death, which condition is the fruit, and effect of Chriſts death, and in this latter ſenſe, the death of Chriſt was not an abſolute purchaſe of reconciliation; 'tis true, the <hi>Arminians</hi> hold that Chriſt hath purchaſed pardon for us upon condition of believing, which believing they make not a fruit of Chriſts death, but of their own free-will, and thus they make Chriſt to open a door of hope for us; but it's poſſible that no man may enter in and be ſaved, and thus by them we have only a ſalvability by Chriſt, but no certainty of ſalvation; but we affirme no ſuch matter, and ſay, that Chriſt ſatisfied Gods juſtice, ſo that God is not <hi>placabilis,</hi> but <hi>placatus,</hi> not appeaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, but appeaſed; and God is now reconciled, and will give pardon, but in that order and method himſelf hath appointed, which is faith; which faith God hath predeſtinated us unto that ſhal be ſaved, &amp; Chriſt hath purchaſed it for us as well as remiſſion of ſins, and therefore it ſhall infallibly be wrought, that there may be an actual application of Chriſts death unto juſtification; now in this ſenſe the death of Chriſt is not abſolute, ſo as to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude any condition, and qualification wrought by the Spirit of Chriſt to apply his death.<note place="margin">Johan.

That interpretation of Scripture which giveth no more to faith then to other works of ſanctification is not true, and the reaſon he addeth is, becauſe the Scripture doth peculiarly attribute our juſtification unto faith, and in a way of oppoſition to other works of ſanctification; But Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi>'s interpretation of thoſe Scriptures that require faith as neceſſary to ſalvation, that they do not declare the perſons that ſhall be ſaved, and have the fruition and enjoyment of the benefits of Chriſt, attributes no more to fairh then to other works of ſanctification; for works of ſanctification declare this.

He ſhall ſee of the travel of his ſoul, and be ſatisfied: By his knowledge ſhall my righteous ſervant juſtifie many.</hi> Theſe words are delivered as in the Perſon of God the Father, with whoſe words the Prophet began, as we may ſee from <hi>Chap.</hi> 52. <hi>v.</hi> 3. <hi>Vide</hi> our Engliſh Annotations, and they clearly hold forth the effect and fruit of Chriſts paſſion; where obſerve a plain pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to Chriſt, or Covenant with him about dying, and mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ſoul an offering for ſin, <hi>When thou ſhalt make his ſoul an offering,</hi> or as the Hebrew, if his ſoul, or when his ſoul ſhall make it ſelfe an offering; for the ſecond Perſon <hi>Maſculine,</hi> and the third <hi>Foeminine</hi> are in letters, and ſound the ſame; ſo I take it the ſpeach of the Father (introduced by the Prophet,) ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto Chriſt, that when his ſoul ſhall make it ſelf an offering for ſin, then he promiſeth <hi>he ſhall ſee his ſeed,</hi> that is, his iſſue and poſterity that ſhould be borne to him as an effect of this, which words do not import, that all his iſſue and poſterity ſhould be an immediate effect of it; but he ſhould ſee it, he ſhould live and ſurvive to ſee it; after his reſurrection he ſhould die no more, but live for ever, and ſee the fruit of his death; <hi>The will of the Lord ſhall proſper in his hand,</hi> that is, he ſhall daily ſee ſouls brought to ſalvation as a fruit of his death: <hi>He ſhall ſee of the travel of his ſoul, and be ſatisfied.</hi> As a woman when her tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel is paſt, is filled with joy to behold the fruit of her wombe; ſo Chriſt ſhould be ſatisfied to ſee a numerous iſſue of faithful ſoules begotten to God by his death. And what that ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is in particular, he tells him it ſhall be the juſtification of many for whom he died, and then he tells him how they ſhall be juſtified; He ſaith, it ſhall be by<note n="*" place="margin">Notitiâ ſui.</note> his knowledge, or the knowledge of him; not his own knowledge taken ſubjectively, the knowledge that he hath of God,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vide</hi> Engliſh Annot.</note> or of them; but his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge taken objectively, that is, the knowledge whereby they know him; and this is not a bare knowledge of Chriſt whereby we are juſtified, for the devils themſelves both know and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge him; but by knowledge is meant faith, the antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent put for the conſequent, becauſe the knowledge of him is the ground of truſt. I ſhall not need to prove that knowledge is put for faith.<note n="*" place="margin">John 17.3. John 4.42.</note> And the words that follow are a reaſon, <hi>for
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:118254:41" rendition="simple:additions"/> he ſhall bear their iniquities;</hi> though in the Hebrew the word is <hi>copulative,</hi> yet it is often uſed as a cauſe. And if this be granted, it renders a reaſon why he ſhould juſtifie them, becauſe he did bear their ſins; where the perſons are deſcribed, whom he ſhould juſtifie, not all promiſcuouſly, but Believers, whoſe ſins he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to diſcharge; for he did bear the ſinnes of none but Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers.</p>
               <p>Now let Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> tell us why God ſpeaking to Chriſt of our juſtification by him, ſhould ſay that Chriſt ſhould juſtifie us by his knowledge, or by faith in him.</p>
               <p n="1">1. His death alone antecedently to faith, did juſtifie thoſe whoſe iniquities he did bear; unleſſe it were to declare his will that his death ſhould be effectually applied only by faith, and that none ſhould have immediate benefit, but expect it by faith.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That that was Gods intention in giving Chriſt, was the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of Chriſt in dying; But God in giving Chriſt, intended not the benefits of Chriſts death unto any untill faith; Therefore Chriſt died not to purchaſe immediate forgiveneſſe unto any untill faith, and by conſequence there was a mutual agreement. The <hi>Major</hi> is beyond all contradict on, becauſe of the unity of heart and will between Chriſt and God; therefore he intended not his death for any, nor in any other way then God intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> is written as with a Sun-beam in Scripture,<note place="margin">John 3.14, 15, 16.</note> 
                  <hi>John</hi> 3.14, 15, 16. <hi>As</hi> Moſes <hi>lifted up the Serpent in the wilderneſſe: Even ſo muſt the Son of man be lifted up: That whoſoever belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth in him ſhould not periſh, but have eternall life. For God ſo loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son: that whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever believeth in him ſhould not periſh, but have everlasting life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In which words you have a threefold cauſe of mans ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The principal, Gods love, <hi>ver.</hi> 16.</item>
                  <item>2. The meritorious, Chriſt death.</item>
                  <item>3. The inſtrumental, our faith.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Secondly, You have a compariſon between Chriſt and his Type, in two things,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That as the Serpent muſt be lifted up for a meanes of heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:118254:42"/> or elſe it could not heal, and none would look to it; ſo there was a neceſſity of Chriſts being lifted up upon the Croſſe, God muſt deliver him up to death, and he muſt be conſidered as dying; or elſe there is no ſalvation by him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The end, that ſuch as did look to it, might be healed of the ſtingings of the fiery Serpent; ſo this was the end of Chriſt dying, <hi>that whoſoever believe, ſhould not periſh.</hi> Now, as the Scripture ſheweth, thoſe ſtingings were deadly, and none were healed but ſuch as looked to the brazen Serpent; ſo are the ſtingings of ſin deadly, and none are healed by Chriſt, but ſuch as believe. Now, as Mr. <hi>Woodbridge</hi> obſerves, they were not firſt healed, and then did look up to ſee what healed them; but they did firſt look, and then were healed: ſo we have nor firſt everlaſting life given us, and then we believe; but firſt we believe, and then we have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting life.</p>
               <p>Now to this Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> anſwers nothing, but <hi>denies it was the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the Holy Ghoſt to ſhew in what order we are juſtified in the ſight of God;</hi> but in ſo doing, he doth not only ſenſeleſſely beg the queſtion, but doth overthrow that wherein the truth and verity of the type conſiſted: for as the brazen Serpent, though endued with a healing vertue, yet it healed none till he did look; ſo, though Chriſt as dying be ſufficiently able to ſave, yet ſaveth not any till he look to him by faith, and in ſo doing doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy that that was the main end of God in giving Chriſt, and of Chriſt in dying, that upon believing we ſhould be ſaved.</p>
               <p>And therefore I come to the third thing conſiderable, and that is Gods end in giving Chriſt, and Chriſts end in dying, both theſe are expreſſed in the ſame words, the Son was lifted up, <hi>that whoſoever believeth, &amp;c.</hi> and Gods end was, <hi>that whoſoever believeth, &amp;c.</hi> where the verity of the <hi>major</hi> is confirmed, that they had the ſame end.</p>
               <p>Now the <hi>Minor</hi> is no leſſe evident; for if Gods end in giving Chriſt to die for us, and Chriſts in dying were to limit the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit only to Believers, then it followes by undeniable conſequence, that untill faith none are actually juſtified by Chriſts death, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the benefit of Chriſts death is equally extended to Believers, and unbelievers; and if he ſaith, faith is only a conſequent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and not antecedent, then he muſt corrupt the Text, and
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:118254:42"/> alter the ſenſe of the Holy Ghoſt, and ſay, that God gave Chriſt to give eternall life, and Chriſt was lifted up to purchaſe eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life, that they for whom he was ſo given, and ſo died, might believe; and thus eternal life muſt be antecedent, and the cauſe of faith, and not faith antecedent or any cauſe of eternall life.</p>
               <p>And therefore as <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> anſwered to one that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed,<note n="*" place="margin">Gregorius Nazianzenus, <hi>Epiſt. ad</hi> Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. <hi>Dialog.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Deum potuiſſe ſine mente hominem ſervare, potuit etiam utique ſine carne, voluntate ſolà, ſicut &amp; alia omnia quae effecit, &amp; effecit corporaliter: tolle ergo unà cum mente &amp; carnem quoque, ut omni ex parte perfecta ſit amentia tua:</hi> So may I ſay to Mr. <hi>Eyre,</hi> who affirmeth that we are juſtified without faith; God might have done it, and without the ſufferings of Chriſt, had he ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed it; take away therefore the death and ſatisfaction of Chriſt, with <hi>Socinus,</hi> (as your doctrine of eternall juſtification doth, as ſhall in its place be made evident) and thus you ſhall declare your ſelf to be perfectly mad.</p>
               <p>A third argument is taken from <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. <hi>Whom God hath ſet forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood;</hi> whence I argue, The agreement between the Father and the Son, was ſuitable to Gods eternal decree; for Chriſt cannot be a propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for ſins otherwiſe then God hath ordained him: If God in his decree hath ordained Chriſt to be a propitiation through faith in his blood only, then it was their agreement Chriſts death ſhould not be available until faith; But God in his decree hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd Chriſt to be a propitiation through faith in his blood. The conſequence of the <hi>major</hi> is evident, becauſe their agreement muſt be ſuitable to this decree. I believe there is ſcarce a man of that face and forehead that will deny the Aſſumption, they are the words of the Apoſtle. Nor let Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> here wilfully miſtake, as if we affirmed that faith made Chriſts death of a propitiatory nature, as if it received its value and worth from faith, this were ridiculous to make the inſtrumentall cauſe a meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous cauſe; but it makes Chriſts death to be peculiarly appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by God, as a propitiation for him in particular that believeth, and never till then.</p>
               <p>A fourth Argement is this, If Chriſt himſelf cannot ſave an unbeliever ſo remaining, then it was the will of God the Father
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:118254:43"/> and of Chriſt, that his death ſhould nor be available before fairh; But Chriſt himſelf cannot ſave an unbeliever ſo remaining; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was the will of the Father and the Sonne that his death ſhould not actually ſave until faith. The conſequence is as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable as the earth; for God the Father, and Chriſt the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour did not will that which was impoſſible for Chriſt to do, therefore they did not will that antecedently to faith, an unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believer ſhould be juſtified, and by conſequence that the benefit of Chriſts death ſhould not be enjoyed before faith. The <hi>Minor</hi> is proved from <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.23. <hi>And they alſo, if they abide not ſtill in unbelief, ſhall be graffed in: for God is able to graffe them in again.</hi> Where the Apoſtle ſpeaking of the hope there is of cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Jewes again that were caſt off for unbelief, from being any members of the viſible Church, and ſo from being members of Chriſts body, and from all preſent hope of ſalvation; ſheweth, that though their caſe be ſeemingly deſperate, yet it is poſſible for them to be ſaved, by an argument drawn from the power of God, <hi>God is able to graffe them in again;</hi> yet he limiteth this abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute power of God, that this is poſſible, <hi>If they abide not in unbelief,</hi> (where though it be true, God is able to remove their unbelief, &amp; to give faith, yet <hi>ſo long as they abide in unbelief, they cannot be graf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed in again, and ſo ſaved;</hi> yea, the very power of God is here limited from ſaving, (to wit, by his own immutable will) not to ſave an unbeliever, and an unbelievers wilful rejecting of the grace God offereth;<note place="margin">Mark 6.5. <hi>compared with</hi> Matth. 13.48.</note> and thus in <hi>Mark</hi> 6.5. Chriſt in his own countrey could do no mighty work there, becauſe of their unbelief; their unbelief was ſo great, that Chriſt marvelled at it, and was in a manner hindred. <hi>Calvin</hi> upon the place ſaith, <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus negans Chriſtum potuiſſe, eorum culpam amplificat à quibus im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedita fuit ejus bonitas. Nam certè increduli, quantum in ſe eſt, Dei manum ſuâ contumaciâ conſtringunt; non quòd Deus quaſi inferior vincatur, ſed quia illi non permittant virtutem ſuam exequi: Mark</hi> denying that Chriſt could do any mighty work there, am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifies their ſinne by whom his goodneſſe was hindred. For certainly the unbelievers, as much as in them lieth, do binde the hands of God by their contumacy; not as if God being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour in power is overcome, but becauſe they will not permit his power to be executed. And truly God hath declared his
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:118254:43" rendition="simple:additions"/> immutable purpoſe in the Goſpel, <hi>that whoſoever believeth not ſhall be damned;</hi> hence Chriſt cannot ſave an unbeliever ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining; therefore untill faith this benefit of Chriſts death is not obtained.</p>
               <p>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> The whole energy and efficacy of Chriſts merit in reſpect of influx and derivation upon others, depends wholly upon the will of God ordaining and accepting it, which appeares if you conſider it in reference to the Elect and Reprobate; for why is it effectual unto one, and not the other? it is the will of God only that makes the difference, becauſe God hath ordained it for the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, and accordingly will give faith to apply it, &amp; not to the other.</p>
               <p>Now my fifth Argument ſhall be by retortion of Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi>'s firſt argument againſt Mr. <hi>Woodbridge, There is no ſuch Covenant doth appear;</hi> Ergo, <hi>there is no ſuch thing. This hath been accounted a good argument amongst Christians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I may draw the like argument from Scripture negatively thus, It is no where written that God accepted the death of Chriſt for unbelievers, that they ſhould be juſtified antecedently unto faith; <hi>Ergo</hi> there was no ſuch will in God, and conſequently not in Chriſt. As for thoſe Scriptures which Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> brings, and ſets them upon the rack, to force them to give evidence to his cauſe; the Reader may expect their anſwer in the Aanaskeuaſtical part of this diſcourſe, where it properly belongs.</p>
               <p n="6">6. God the Father and the Son intended the benefit of Chriſts death only for the members of Chriſt; and till they be the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of his myſtical body, they cannot be partakers of the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of his death, and have communion with him in it; for as none partake in <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne that were not in him by a natural union, ſo none but ſuch as are in Chriſt by ſpiritual and ſupernatural u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion can be partakers of his ſufferings and ſatisfaction; but none are members of Chriſts myſtical body untill faith; therefore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till faith it was the will of the Father and the Sonne, that none ſhould partake in the benefits of his death. This argument ſhall be more fully vindicated ere long from the objection Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> made againſt it in our diſcourſe.</p>
               <p n="7">7. If Chriſt in his interceſſion, (which is the beſt <hi>Index</hi> and Interpreter of his minde, and intention in his death) limits and reſtraines the benefits of his interceſſion to Beleevers, then it was
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:118254:44"/> his minde and intention in his death to limit the benefits thereof unto Believers; becauſe Chriſts intention of the benefits of his death, and the fruit of his interceſſion are of equall latitude, and by conſequence what was his minde, was the Fathers minde; for Chriſt and his Father are one, and have the ſame will; but Chriſt limits the benefits of his interceſſion unto Beleevers, as we may ſee in <hi>John</hi> 17.20. Chriſt prayes for them that ſhall believe in him;<note place="margin">John 17.20. Heb. 7.25.</note> nor do theſe places only declare who ſhall have the benefit of Chriſts interceſſion; but how, and when it ſhall be obtained; by faith, by coming unto Chriſt; for if they did obtain it before faith immediately from his death, what need were there of Chriſts interceſſion for that which they did already enjoy? From whence I argue,</p>
               <p n="8">8. That that deſtroyes the end and uſe of Chriſts interceſſion, cannot be agreeable to Scripture. But to make Chriſts death to juſtifie us actually and immediately, this deſtroyes the end of his interceſſion; for Chriſt is now in heaven an Advocate for ſin, that it might be pardoned to them that believe: ſo that Chriſt in his death took it away meritoriouſly, and now he is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to intercede for all that by faith ſeek for the benefits of his death, that it may be formally applied.</p>
               <p>Yea, the children of God though they fall not from the ſtate of juſtification by new ſins, they loſe not their right to heaven, yet they loſe their aptitude for heaven, and by every new ſin they contract a new guilt, and without a new remiſſion of the ſins committed they cannot be ſaved; and hence Chriſt is a dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Advocate to intercede for us, as St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>My little children,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 John 2.1.</note> 
                  <hi>if any man ſin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the righteous.</hi> I might adde to theſe many m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>re, but theſe are ſufficient to demonſtrate this truth, and will prove a burdenſome ſtone to Mr. <hi>Eyre,</hi> if he endeavour to contrad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ct them.</p>
               <p>And as for thoſe Arguments which he, <hi>Chap.</hi> 14. uſeth to prove the actuall and immediate reconciliation of the Elect be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore faith, they have all the ſame unhappineſſe to fall, like ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, farre ſhort of the mark intended, and have moſt of them the ſame common fate to be guilty of a miſerable <hi>non ſequitur,</hi> as ſhall in my reply to them in its proper place appear.</p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:118254:44"/>
               <p>Now the next thing to be ſuperadded for a full vindication of this truth, is, that this ſuſpending the benefits of Chriſts death until faith, is no way derogatory to the atonement made by Chriſts death, which may as eaſily be proved, as that <hi>Pilate</hi> was guilty of Chriſts blood.</p>
               <p>And I prove it thus, 1. If there were ſuch an agreement, as the arguments above declare, then what wrong is it to the atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made by Chriſts death, that the effect of it ſhould not be enjoyed untill faith, when as it was the mutuall agreement between the Father and the Son to have it ſo? it was his will to have it ſo, and <hi>volenti non fit injuria,</hi> there is no injury to him that is willing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If the death of Chriſt were in value a ſufficient ranſome for the whole world, the very Reprobates not excepted, and yet without injury and wrong to Chriſts ſatisfaction, it is by the will of God ordaining, and ſo accepting it to be only effectual for the Elect, which comparatively in reſpect of the Reprohates is a ſmall number; why ſhall it be judged a wrong to Chriſts ſatisfaction, that the benefit of it for whom it is intended, ſhould be for a time ſuſpended, for gracious and good ends at the will of the Father, to make them ſee what they are, and deſerve, and what need they have of Chriſt, and to raiſe up their deſires after him, and to increaſe their love unto God for Chriſt, and alſo for the honour of the Lord and his Chriſt; that though he ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie the ungodly, yet that he doth not juſtifie them ſo remaining, that his enmity and hatred againſt ſin may the more appear, and that wicked men might not think God a juſtifier of the wicked in their abominations, which is contrary to the purity of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and juſtice to do: why ſhould this be thought more inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to Chriſts ſatisfaction, then a peremptory excluding of all the race of the Reprobates from ſalvation by his death?</p>
               <p>But, 3. If notwithſtanding the ſuſpending the benefits of Chriſts death untill faith, the death of Chriſt be no leſſe ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory to divine juſtice, and the intrinſecal worth and value of his merits no whit leſſened, and the efficacy, and certainty of the effects of Chriſts death be no leſſe eſtabliſhed by our Doctrine, then if the effect did immediately follow, then this is no impair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:118254:45"/> of the atonement made by his death; but the premiſes are true, which I evidence thus:</p>
               <p n="1">1. We willingly grant that the death of Chriſt was a full and compleat ſatisfaction to divine juſtice, and a valuable compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation for the ſins of thoſe that ſhall be ſaved; and God did not accept leſſe at the hands of Chriſt, then was due to our ſins; but he made ſatisfaction, <hi>ad ultimum quadrantem,</hi> to the laſt farthing; the juſtice of God can require no more, either at his hands, or at the hands of thoſe for whom he ſuffered by way of ſatisfaction; and hence in his reſurrection he gave him a publick acquittance, and ſent his Angel to roll away the ſtone from the Sepulchre, as a publick Officer to teſtifie his acquitting him from the debt of our ſins, and ſo he ſets him at liberty, and brings him out of priſon.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The intrinſecall value and worth of Chriſts merits is no way diminiſhed: Chriſt did not compound with the Father, as broken debtors with the creditour, making him to take leſſe then was due; nay, as we have ſhewed in ſome reſpect (if you conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the dignity of the perſon) there was more laid down then the Law required, though in regard of the ſubſtance of the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it was that which the Law required, and the juſtice of God, and the love of the Father could require no more; the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation or deferring the actuall enjoyment of the thing pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed by that ſatisfaction, ariſeth not from any impotency or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in Chriſts ſufferings, but from the liberty of Gods will, who in mercy accepts of that which a ſurety hath done for us, which in it ſelf was refuſable, till by an act of grace it was admitted as available for us; but in that time onely that the Father ſhould appoint, whoſe will Chriſt as a Mediatour, and Servant was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to obey.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The death of Chriſt is no leſſe efficacious, and certain in the effects of it, then if an immediate participation of it were granted; the efficaciouſneſſe of Chriſts death is not to be valued by the time of application (it being a moral cauſe, and not a phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical, or natural cauſe of juſtification, but by the powerfulneſſe of the impetration, and the certainty of application,) now we grant that it hath by way of merit procured reconciliation; and hence our deliverance is called redemption,<note place="margin">Rom. 3.24.</note> which was made

               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Arminians</hi> hold that Chriſt died indefinitely for all without diſtinction, and that he died no more for <hi>Peter</hi> then for <hi>Judas;</hi> and that he paid a ſufficient ſatisfaction for all, ſo that God may now freely remit the ſins of all.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They maintain a poteſtative, or voluntary condition, which they borrow from the Juriſts, whereby, it being left free to their own will, whether they will believe or not; the effect of Chriſts death is rendred uncertain, whether they ſhall be ſaved or not, and ſo they affirme all to be redeemed; ſo as that it is poſſible none may be ſaved; they hold as it were a potential reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is by the act of faith to be compleated, which faith they affirme not to be the effect of Chriſts death, but of their own free will.

               <p>Now we utterly diſclaime faith to be a condition in either of theſe ſenſes; we ſay, that Chriſt died only <hi>ſufficienter</hi> for the Reprobate, but <hi>efficiently</hi> for the Elect; Chriſt did not die in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definitely, and <hi>indiſ criminatim</hi> alike for all, but he died effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually for <hi>Peter,</hi> and not for <hi>Judas;</hi> and whereas we make faith the condition of the Covenant, without which the benefits of the death of Chriſt is not applied to us, we mean not in an <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minian</hi> (much leſſe in a Popiſh) ſenſe, that faith is an uncertain condition left to the power or freedome of our will; but we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly affirme, that God hath infallibly ordained ſuch unto faith as ſhall be ſaved,<note place="margin">Acts 13.48. John 6.37. <hi>Maſter</hi> Eyre, <hi>p.</hi> 144. <hi>ſect.</hi> 9.</note> and Chriſt hath merited this grace of Faith for us, which Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> is pleaſed without all charity to affirme, that his adverſaries cannot mean faith a condition in this ſenſe, as that which God will beſtow, and is the fruit of Chriſts death. And he ſaith, Mr. <hi>Woodbridge</hi> denies it to be a fruit of the Covenant, and well he might, as it is a Covenant made with us; for it is an abſolute promiſe made by God as a fruit of his Election, and Chriſts redemption, that he will work this faith whereby we ſhall be brought into Covenant with him; for when God promiſeth to write his Laws in their mindes, in ſo promiſing he promiſeth faith,<note place="margin">Jer. 31.38.

                  <hi>Eyre</hi> falſly affirmeth (which I believe he was not ignorant of) lay the whole weight of our ſalvation upon an uncertain condition of our own performing; we make faith to be Gods gift, though it be our act. And we make the ſalvation of the Elect as ſure as himſelf, and therefore our doctrine is no way diſconſolatory to the ſoules of any; only we do not ſtrengthen the hands of the wicked, making them to refuſe to returne, by promiſing them life as he doth,<note place="margin">Ezek. 13.22, 23.</note> by telling them of their eternal juſtification, and of their being actually reconciled from the time of Chriſts death;<note place="margin">Iſa. 48.22.</note> for we know of no comfort belonging to the wicked, while unregenerate; for, <hi>There is no peace, ſaith my God, to the wicked;</hi> but ſo are all unregenerate perſons Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedently to their faith.</p>
               <p>And for a further clearing of my minde in this particular, I adde, that if by uncertain Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> mean, as oftentimes the word is ſo taken, for that which in its own nature is contingent, in reſpect of the ſecond cauſe; becauſe what is contingent uſually among men, is uncertain, and not in reſpect of God to whom by his predeterminating will, even contingent things come to paſſe neceſſarily, though they come to paſſe contingently in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to us; I deny not but in this ſenſe it may be called uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, or contingent, and this is no more then what is unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly acknowledged by the Orthodox, and that no way hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the ſalvation of the Elect.</p>
               <p>And by this time I hope the Reader plainly ſeeth this truth of Chriſt, that the very Elect are without Chriſt, and without hope in the world, as the Apoſtle affirmeth, untill faith; that they have no actuall right or intereſt in the death of Chriſt until faith; and ſo as to their preſent eſtate, there is no difference between them and Reprobates, <hi>being children of wrath, as well as others;</hi> this is that which the tender eares of Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> cannot bear; but I believe it ſounds not ſo harſh in the ears of a judicious Reader, as being an undoubted truth of God; but let it be compared with that filthy and dirty opinion of Mr. <hi>Eyre,</hi> more beſeeming the Gnoſticks of old, or the preſent Ranters of this age, then a ſober Chriſtian, which is this,<note place="margin">

               <p n="2">2. A ſecond Errour I conceive him guilty of, is, in that he ſaith, That the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt doth come upon all the Elect unto Juſtification, in the ſame manner as <hi>Adams</hi> ſin came upon all men to condemnation, (and it's ſo much the worſe that he will father it upon the Apoſtle, which he no way intended in that place,) that as <hi>Adams</hi> ſin came upon men to condemnation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they had a being, that ſo the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt was imputed to the Elect before they had a being; To which I anſwer, that it is a manifeſt untruth, for the ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> deſcends upon us, not only by imputation, but by propagation, ſo doth not the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, that is ours only by imputation.

               <p>Firſt, then I ſuppoſe Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> muſt mean that ſingle act of diſobedience, which was <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, and is made ours, with the effects of it: Now if you look upon that barely as a ſimple act, it was more Gods then his act, in reſpect of the ſubſtance of the action; for, <hi>In him we live, and move, and have our being;</hi> and did not he uphold us, and concurre with us by his natural concourſe, we could put forth no action; and thus farre in <hi>genere entis</hi> it was good; but if you look upon the ſinfulneſſe of that act, as it was a tranſgreſſion of the Law of God forbidding him to eat, ſo it was evil in <hi>generis moris,</hi> and from <hi>Adam</hi> as from the principal cauſe, by the abuſe of his free will, and a double effect, or guilt attended this offence:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Reatus culpae,</hi> the inward guilt of ſin, or deſert of damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is an inſeparable adjunct, and conſequent of ſinne.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is <hi>Reatus redundans in perſonam,</hi> or <hi>reatus poenae,</hi> which is a guilt of puniſhment obliging rhe ſinner to eternall wrath, which is ſeparable from it. This is a conſequent of ſin, by vertue of Gods Law adjudging puniſhment unto ſin, in which repſect as it is from God as a puniſhment of ſin, it is good, and God may ſeparate this from ſin.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Adam</hi> when he committed this ſin, did ſuſtaine a double perſon.</p>
               <p n="1">1. His own.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The perſon of all his poſterity, whom he did as a common

               <p>Now I take this as an errour of great conſequence that Maſter <hi>Eyre</hi> ſaith, that we are not ſinners by <hi>Adam,</hi> or that the iſſues of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin came not upon his poſterity by propagation but by vertue of the Covenant made with him as a common perſon in the behalf of his poſterity, for many reaſons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe he maketh <hi>Adams</hi> ſin only to be ours by imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or an act of pure and abſolute Sovereignty, and Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and no way an act of juſtice, when as it is a mixt act; not only an act of Prerogative and Sovereignty in ordaining <hi>Adam</hi> to be a common perſon, and ſo his ſin to be the ſin of the whole nature; for God could have ordered it ſo, had it been his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, that this ſin ſhould only have been perſonal, as his other ſins after the fall are. But it is an act of juſtice alſo, for death is inflicted as a puniſhment upon all, which is an act of juſtice. The reaſon followes in the fifth of the <hi>Romans, Becauſe in him
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:118254:53"/> all have ſinned, ſo that death is the wages of that ſin,</hi> becauſe it is our ſin, all ſinned in him; and it is not only <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, but their own ſin by vertue of their relation to him, being in his loynes. And to make the bare and ſtrict imputation of another mans ſin, (which is no way ours, but by imputation, the ſole ground and foundation of that heavy judgement, and puniſhment of condemning all mankinde to eternall death, which is one of the moſt weighty acts of Gods judgement, that was ever exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted in the world, is to repreſent God, not ſo much as a juſt Judge, as one that delighteth in the death of his creature, in the blood and ruine of his creature,) when as he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth that as <hi>he doth live, he hath no delight in the death of a ſinner,</hi> much leſſe of a creature, that were not a ſinner, if it were not for his imputation. And although I doubt not but God may as an act of Sovereignty, adjudge an innocent creature unto pain and miſery, if it were his will; and that it would leſs reflect upon God to ſay he dit it, becauſe it was his abſolute plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, then to pretend or conceive that the bare imputation of the act of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin was the cauſe of it; yet I have no warrant to ſay that ever God did, or will do ſuch an act to make the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture miſerable, meerly to ſhew his Sovereignty. And what is there in the imputation of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, if this imputation be grounded upon his will, and not that naturall union and relation between <hi>Adam</hi> and his poſterity, to free it from ſuch an act of pure So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty; therefore I look upon it as an act of juſtice, as well as prerogative, the equity of which act lieth much in the relation of <hi>Adam</hi> and his poſterity to one another.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I urge, as before I hinted, If death entred by ſin, then Gods imputation is not the onely cauſe of it; But <hi>it entred by ſin,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Death paſſed upon all, inaſmuch as all have ſinned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Then <hi>Adam</hi> was only the occaſion of our ſin, but God the Authour; for if <hi>Adam</hi> had ſinned, if God had not imputed it, we had not been ſinners; But this is an inſufferable blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy to make God the Author of ſinne; Therefore Gods imputing it, is an act of juſtice, and not of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty only.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This overthrowes the community of his perſon, for if it
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:118254:53" rendition="simple:additions"/> be meerly an act of his will, he might have done this though <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> had not been a publick perſon.</p>
               <p n="5">5. This aſcribeth to God a fallible judgement in eſteeming him a ſinner that is innocent, and is not a ſinner but by his imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="6">6. This aſcribeth injuſtice to God, to impute ſin to him that is no ſinner, but by his imputation, which the ſinner would be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from, and conſents not to it, as the regenerate that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile it, and earneſtly deſire to be delivered from it.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The very neceſſity that there was for Chriſt to be borne of a Virgin, conceived of the Holy Ghoſt, to prevent his being a ſinner, confutes this conceit; for if <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne be ours only by imputation, let but God not impute <hi>Adams</hi> ſin to Chriſt, and he intended not ſo miraculouſly to be borne, for it behoved him to be like us in all things; and why not by the help of man to be borne, if <hi>Adams</hi> ſin be ours by imputation only, and not by propagation alſo? Thus you ſee how many errours Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> is driven unto, to hold and maintaine one. Nor are his reaſons of any weight that he produceth to prove, that the iſſues of <hi>Adams</hi> diſobedience came not upon his poſterity by vertue of their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral propagation, for then his ſin ſhould not be imputed untill they are actually propagated; if he meant of an actual and formall imputation of ſin, it is granted that ſin is not ſo imputed till an actuall being. For the underſtanding of this, we muſt know what imputation of ſin is; it implieth either an eſtimation and judging of a ſinner to be a ſinner, or an adjudication of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment for that ſin, or the execution of that puniſhment; now look, in what manner we are ſinners, in that manner is the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, for Gods judgement muſt be according to truth; now as we are but ſeminally, potentially and virtually ſinners, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we had but a virtual exiſtence in <hi>Adam,</hi> (for it is a known rule, and of approved verity, <hi>Operatio rei conſequitur eſſe rei,</hi> The acts and operations of things ſtill follow the being of things, and are ſuitable and proportionable thereunto,) ſo we are reputed by God only virtually ſinful in <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſo not actual ſinners, nor ſo reputed by God, nor formally obliged to puniſhment; nor any puniſhment actually, or formally to be inflicted, till we have an actuall exiſtence; hence by vertue of that Covenant
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:118254:54"/> made with <hi>Adam,</hi> we are not actually and formally conſtituted ſinners till we are actuall members, and ſo his argument will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn upon himſelf. For if the righteouſneſs of Chriſt come upon us in the ſame manner to Juſtification, as <hi>Adams</hi> ſin to condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then as we are not actually ſinners, till we have an actual being; ſo neither are we actually juſtified, till we be actuall members of Chriſt by faith.</p>
               <p>His ſecond Reaſon halteth right down, and is pittifully incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent, for it doth no way follow, that if the ſinne of <hi>Adam</hi> be ours by propagation, that therefore the ſins of other parents ſhould be imputed to their poſterity, as much as <hi>Adams,</hi> becauſe they deſcend as naturally from their immediate parents, as from <hi>Adam;</hi> but rather the conſequence ſhould be, Therefore our next parents do as truly tranſmit and propagate that ſin, as <hi>Adam</hi> to their children; and this is true, and will advantage your cauſe nothing, nor hinder ours; but it followes not that their perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſins ſhould be imputed, as was <hi>Adams</hi> firſt ſin: For if no more of <hi>Adams</hi> ſins be imputed then that firſt tranſgreſſion, why ſhould the ſins of any other parents be imputed? And the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is not alike, for none but <hi>Adam</hi> could be a publick perſon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting all mankinde; and that ſin was not only perſonal, and proper to <hi>Adam,</hi> but common to the whole nature, and that by the will of God ordaining him a publick perſon. For it is a mixt act in God, when he doth impute <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, partly ariſing from his Sovereignty, and partly from his Juſtice grounded upon that naturall relation, although I deny not upon other conſiderations the ſins of the immediate parents ſometimes are, and may be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to the children. And whereas he ſaith, Unleſſe they can ſhew any <hi>proviſo,</hi> or reſtriction in the ſecond Covenant more then in the firſt, why life ſhould not as immediately flow from Chriſts obedience to the Elect, as death did from <hi>Adams</hi> diſobedience, the Argument will ſtand in force.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, here needs no other <hi>proviſo,</hi> or reſtriction, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſhew that we are not in Chriſt in a natural way, as we are in <hi>Adam;</hi> and therefore the benefits of his death cannot imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately follow our birth, or be antecedent to it, but is limited to the time of our ingraffing into Chriſt; and the parallel holds
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:118254:54"/> firme; for as in <hi>Adam</hi> we all virtually ſinned, and ſo were vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually condemned; ſo we grant, Chriſt hath meritoriouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed us, and we are virtually juſtified in him; and as ſinne is not actually imputed unto any of <hi>Adams</hi> poſterity, till they have an actuall being, and are actually members of <hi>Adam;</hi> ſo are not we actually juſtified, till we be actual members of Chriſt by faith. As for the Logical Axiom, <hi>Non entis nulla ſunt accidentia,</hi> it was uſed in my next Argument, and therefore I ſhall conſider it in its proper place.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y next Argument againſt which Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> is riſen up to offer violence, was drawn from our union to Chriſt. Where there is no union, there can be no communion, for union is the ground of all communion, which I made evident by an induction of the ſeverall unions in the world; and that there was no communion where there was not a preceding union; But we are not united unto Chriſt untill faith; Therefore we had no communion with him in his death to an actual juſtification. And in the further proſecuting of the Argument, I ſhewed that this union is ſuch a union, whereby the perſon of a Believer is united to the perſon of Chriſt; therefore it did preſuppoſe the pre-exiſtence of the perſon before he could be united, and that this union was a thing accidental as to the nature of man, and it being attributed to us as the ſubjects of this union, it muſt require our exiſtence;

               <p>Firſt, he ſaith, that I called our union with Chriſt a perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall union, which ſeems to fav ur that abſurd notion, that a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever loſeth not only his own proper life, but his perſonali<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

I am ſorry that I muſt confute him as the fellow did <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in one word; —and his ſhameleſſe dealing in this reſpect, is the more injuriouſly evident, in that I did not only tell him in our conference in publick before a great multitude of witneſſes, that I neither ſaid nor did own any ſuch thing; but did decla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e that I ſaid and meant that it was ſuch a union, whereby the perſon of Chriſt is united to the perſon of a Bel ever; yet is he a man of that face and fore-head, to print and declare that to the world, which he hath God, Angels and men, if not his own conſcience, to witneſſe againſt him; but this he hath done to render me o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious to the world; the Lord forgive him, and let him ſee the evil of theſe, and the like ſlanders againſt me and others of his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren that differ from him. And let him now know, that I utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abhor that Familiſtical notion, that there ſhould be an hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaticall union between Chriſt and a Believer, for Chriſt is one perſon, and a Believer another, <hi>Apage Theologiam hanc erco rele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gandam.</hi> I forced my ſelf publickly to oppoſe it, as you may ſee in the Epiſtle before my Sermon, and whether your Doctrine or mine do moſt favour that abſurd notion that the Reverend Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor doth condemne,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Chambers.</hi>
                  </note> that a Believer, loſeth not only his own proper life, but his perſonality alſo, and is taken up into the perſon, into the nature and perſon of the Son of God, I deſire no better Umpire to determine.</p>
               <p>I affirme, that the union made between us and Chriſt by faith, is ſuch a union whereby the perſon of a Believer is united to the perſon of Chriſt; What is here that ſavours of ſuch a notion? yea,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Hooker, Souls union.</hi> pag 7, 8.</note> what is there which our Reverend Divines have not ſaid before me?

Chriſt is the Head of the Church, not only according as he is God, but as he is God and man; and a Believer is a member, not only according to his body, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his body and ſoul; whole Chriſt being the Head, and the whole Believer being a Member; therefore a whole Chriſt, and a whole believer muſt be joyned together.</p>

               <p>The firſt, that it is a ſubſtantial union, in that the perſon of him that believeth, is united to the perſon of Chriſt; but Maſter <hi>Eyre</hi> makes all the Elect to be one perſon with Chriſt antecedent to their faith; <hi>Becauſe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>they are given to Chriſt, and Chriſt to them, and are ſaid to be in him, that they are called his ſheep, children, before they believe,</hi> which ſavours of this notion more then mine, making them one perſon in Chriſt before they had a being; ſure then their perſonality by him is ſwallowed up in the perſon of the Son of God, if he can finde them being, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſting, and actually juſtified as one perſon with him, before they have either being or faith.</p>
               <p>He ſaith that this is called a myſtical and ſpiritual union, becauſe it is ſecret, and inviſible, apprehended by faith, and not by ſenſe and reaſon; ſurely this is not only apprehended by faith, but it is made, and is a formal effect of faith; the Spirit worketh this faith, by which we are united to Chriſt. And it hath hitherto been the unanimous Doctrine of all our Divines, that this myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal union is made by faith, which Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> oppoſeth, and will have it to be antecedent to it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I will inſtance in a few. Mr.</hi> Reynolds <hi>in his Sermon upon the Life of Chriſt,</hi> pag. 450. <hi>ſaith, Conſider further the formall ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of faith, which is to unite a man unto Chriſt; by meanes of which union, Christ and we are one body; and being thus united, the death and merit of Chriſt is ours. So,</hi> pag. 478. <hi>Conſider faith in its inherent properties, ſo it is not more noble then the reſt, (that is, then other graces) but conſider it as an inſtrument appointed by God
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:118254:56"/> for the moſt noble offices; ſo it is the moſt ſuperlative, and excellent grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The firſt of theſe offices,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is to unite to Chriſt, and give poſſeſſion of him; the Apoſtle prayes for the</hi> Epheſians,<note place="margin">Eph. 3.17.</note> that Chriſt may dwell in their hearts by faith. <hi>And a little after, This union to, and communion with Chriſt, is on our part the work of faith, which is as it were the ſpiritual joynt and ligament by which Chriſt and a Chriſtian are coupled.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John 14.19.</note> 
                  <hi>In one place</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>We are ſaid to live by Chriſt,</hi> Becauſe I live, ye ſhall live alſo, <hi>in another</hi> by faith: <hi>How, by both? by Chriſt as the Fountain, by Faith as the Pipe, conveigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing water to us from the fountaine; by Chriſt as the Foundation, by Faith as the Cement; and in anſwer to an Objection,</hi> pag. 479.<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Reynolds</hi> Life of Chriſt.</note> 
                  <hi>do not other graces joyne a man to Chriſt as well as Faith? <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion is the proper effect of love, therefore we are one as well by loving him, as by believing in him. To this</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I anſwer, Love makes a moral union in affections, but Faith makes a myſticall uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and a little after,</hi> pag. 480. <hi>Between Gods love and ours comes faith to make us one with Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And then the ſecond Office of Faith,</hi> (he ſaith) <hi>is to juſtifie, in the ſame place. So Mr.</hi> Shepherd <hi>in his</hi> Sound Believer, pag. 111. <hi>Look as diſunion is the disjunction or ſeparation of divers things one from another; ſo union is the conjunction, or joyning of them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that were before ſevered: Hence that act of the Spirit in u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niting us to Chriſt, can be nothing elſe but the bringing back the ſoul unto Chriſt, or the conjunction of the ſoul unto Chriſt, and into Chriſt, by bringing it back to him, that before lay like a dry bone ſeparated from him. Thus,</hi> 1 Cor 6.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

In reſpect of this conjunction we are ſaid to be in Chriſt, to put on Chriſt, and Chriſt to dwell in our hearts; this active receiving of Chriſt is an elicite act of faith, whereby he that is called, doth now wholly rely on Chriſt as his Saviour, and by Chriſt on God.<note place="margin">John 3.15, 16.</note> I may ſpare paines of relating any more teſtimonies of ſuch a known truth; and yet Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> will have this myſtical union to be apprehended, not made by faith.</p>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:118254:57"/>
               <p>Secondly, Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> excepteth againſt it as propounded uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally, that there is no manner of union between Chriſt and the Elect before they do believe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They are his own words, not mine, for there is a unity of natures in which they agree, and a certain relative reſpect or u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, very improperly ſo called, between Chriſt and his Elect; but a myſtical union I know none till faith; and were there any real union before, yet Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> might have known that rule, <hi>Analogum quando per ſe poſitum ſtat pro famoſiori Analogato,</hi> and ſo it ought to have been taken for this famous union, or implan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation by faith.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, He acknowledgeth, that <hi>That conjugal union between them, which conſiſts in the mutuall conſent of parties, is not before faith.</hi> And is not this to yield the cauſe?<note place="margin">Eph. 5.23, 32.</note> is not this the myſtical union ſpoken of in Scripture, and ſo called in relation to the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude it beareth to the marriage-union? and is there any more myſtical unions then one? and that made by faith; hath the wife any right or property to the body, name, goods of the man till ſhe be married to her husband? So till this conjugal marriage-union between Chriſt and a Believer, he hath no actual right, or property to the Body, Name, Goods and Purchaſes of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, And yet he addeth, <hi>There is a true and real union, that by means thereof their ſins do become Chriſts, and Chriſts righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe is made theirs.</hi> Shall we not need any more proof of this but your bare word? where is it written there is ſuch a union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore faith? by whom is it beſides your ſelf ſo called? and by what name is that union diſtinguiſhed from the myſtical union by faith?</p>
               <p>But let us hear this proof; <hi>God from everlaſting conſtituted and ordained Christ to be as it were one heap or lumpe, one vine, one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy or ſpirituall corporation, wherein Chriſt is the Head, and they the Members; Chriſt the Root, and they the Branches; Chriſt the firſt fruits, and they the reſidue of the heap; in reſpect of this union, it is that they are ſaid to be given unto Chriſt, and Chriſt to them, to be in Chriſt,</hi> Epheſ. 1. <hi>That they are called his ſheep, his ſeed, his children, his brethren before they are Believers; and by vertue of this union it is, that the obedience and ſatisfaction of Chriſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends particularly to them, and not the reſt of mankinde.</hi> Oh rare
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:118254:58" rendition="simple:additions"/> invention! Oh myſterious union hidden from all ages, but now revealed and diſcovered by Mr. <hi>William Eyre,</hi> a diſcovery as far excelling that of <hi>Columbus,</hi> as heaven exceeds earth! This is ſuch a myſtical union, as that it is not only not to be apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſenſe and reaſon, (becauſe againſt both) but not to be comprehended by faith neither, becauſe it is no where written; but let us weigh the ſtrength of his words, which carry this ſenſe, Becauſe God from everlaſting conſtituted, and ordained Chriſt to be a Head, and Believers to be Members; therefore there was ſuch a union from eternity. As good conſequence as this, your Book is in print, therefore it is all true. But I take this to be a groſſe errour, that the Elect and Chriſt were united from eternity: For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Gods decree ordaining Chriſt to be a Head, is <hi>terminus di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minuens,</hi> and doth not ſignifie that Chriſt was actually a Head, having members united to him; but it ſignifies Gods purpoſe what he did decree to be done in time, and it is the continuall panalogizing of Mr. <hi>Eyre,</hi> and the <hi>Antinomians,</hi> to confound the decree, and the execution of the decree; God decreed to ſend Chriſt into the world, was he therefore actually ſent? No, not till the fulneſſe of time came; Gods decree ordaining Chriſt to be a Head, and they to be Members, doth not actually conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute Chriſt a Head, and they his Members.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That that is not, cannot be united; for union requires ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily the pre-exiſtence of the perſons or things united; But now Believers did not exiſt, much leſſe exiſt as Believers from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, Chriſt had not a myſtical body from etern<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ty; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was not a Head from eternity.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This union to Chriſt is reciprocal, whereby Chriſt is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited to a Believer, and a Believer to Chriſt, and requires li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaments, and bonds to make this union; the Sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rit on Chriſts part, Faith on ours: But they that exiſt not, are not ſubjects capable of receiving the Spirit, or of Faith, without which this union cannot be made.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Scripture no where ſpeaks of an eternall union, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there was no ſuch union; and as he telleth us, <hi>We muſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don him if he believe not our unwritten verities</hi>

               <p>I confeſſe Chriſt is the Head of the Elect and predeſtinate, but not formally conſidered: For neither the predeſtinate as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinate, are members of Chriſts body, but rather ſhall be members of it; for, what is a member of Chriſt, without all doubt exiſteth: For neither is a member of Chriſt a term dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing exiſtence; But the predeſtinate as predeſtinate do not exiſt, for predeſtination was from eternity; but the predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate do not ſimply exiſt from eternity. This day there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:118254:60"/> that are Elect, which undoubtedly are not yet borne.</p>
               <p>Again, that union by which we are made his members, is made by faith; therefore it is needful, that all that are his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers ſhould be Believers; but all the predeſtinate do not prove Beli vers as ſoon as they are predeſtinate. Moreover, ſeeing a Head cannot ſooner be a Head of any then they can be members of his body; it followeth that Chriſt was not a Head from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, becauſe he was not a myſticall body from eternity, or members, in which reſpect he may properly be called the Head of his Church. But ſeeing they are made members of his body by calling, from whence it is called the Chu ch, and that by ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual vocation, and conſequently by faith; it appeareth that Chriſt cannot firſt be called a Head before there are ſome who believe in him, I ſpeak of Chriſt the Mediatour and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer.</p>
               <p>Now, 1. That we were not united unto Chriſt at the time of his paſſion, when our ſins were laid upon him as our ſurety.</p>
               <p>And, 2. That we are not united antecedently to our faith, I prove by theſe enſuing reaſons.</p>
               <p>Although it be willingly acknowledged that Chriſt was a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon perſon in his death, and a ſurety for all the Elect, and what he did was for them; yet this conſtitutes not the myſtical union between Chriſt and us; this only rendred him capable of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving our ſins imputed to h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="1">1. Chriſt is united to us, as he is a Head, and we his members; but the conſideration of Chriſt as dying for us,<note place="margin">Ratio capitis non eſt ratio cauſae merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riae, Dr. <hi>Twiſſ.</hi> in anſw. to Mr. <hi>Cotton.</hi> p. <hi>10.</hi>
                  </note> and ſo becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a meritorious cauſe of our ſalvation, is different from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of Chriſt as a Head; for in his death as he is our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour, purchaſing ſalvation by the merit of it; he is an effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent moral cauſe of ſalvation, and in this channel runnes the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious cauſe; but Chriſt as he is a Head, is an efficient phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicall and naturall cauſe of ſalvation, and thus only he is a Head by actual pouring out his Spirit upon the Elect in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed time for their converſion, whereby they are brought to faith, and ſo united to Chriſt. Now the moral cauſe may exiſt long before the effect follow, and therefore doth not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily require the exiſtence of the ſubject, but the efficient natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral

               <p n="2">2. To make a myſticall union between Chriſt and the Elect before their birth, or faith, be it when it will, whether from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity or Chriſts death,<note place="margin">

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:118254:61"/> that we were puniſhed in Chriſt, but that we cannot properly be ſaid to be puniſhed in him.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, Nor do I abſolutely deny it, if that Doctrine, that we were puniſhed in Chriſt be underſtood in reſpect of imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, (to wit) that God for the merit of Chriſts paſſion forgiveth our ſins upon believing, as if we had ſuffered and made ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, I willingly grant it, but then we were not in him as one perſon making ſatisfaction; for the perſon of him that ſuffered for us, is diſtinguiſhed from them for whom he ſuffered, and by Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi>'s opinion that we were really one in him, and with him before our birth, and faith can be underſtood no other way, as I conceive.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That to make us to be one with Chriſt antecedently to our birth when he ſuffered for us, deſtroyes the ground of imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſts righteouſneſſe; for thoſe which were truly in Chriſt in all his obedience and ſufferings, to them that obedience and ſufferings cannot be made over by imputation; for what need is there of imputation, or what place is left for it, when thoſe to whom it ſhould be imputed, becauſe of their union with Chriſt, did themſelves performe it? wherefore, either there was no ſuch union, or that imputation muſt be denied. But the obedience and ſufferings of Chriſt are evidently by Scripture de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be ours by imputation:<note place="margin">Rom. 4.5.</note> Hence our faith is ſaid to be imputed to us for righteouſneſſe; And Chriſt was made ſin for us, that we might be made the righteouſneſſe of God in him; we are made righteouſneſſe, as he was made ſin, that was by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, therefore we were made righteous by imputation;<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.21.</note> hence that union Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> contends for, I cannot ſay, <hi>mole ruit ſuâ,</hi> but for want of weight falls to the ground.</p>
               <p>The next thing that we have undertaken to prove is, that there is not any myſtical union between Chriſt and us inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedently to faith, which I demonſtrate from Scripture-grounds thus:</p>
               <p>Firſt, if Chriſt prayeth for thoſe for whom he died that they may believe, and that (believing) they may be united to him, then before faith, ſuch (for whom Chriſt died) are not united to him; But Chriſt prayeth for thoſe for whom he died, that they might believe, and that (believing) they might be one with him.
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:118254:62"/> The conſequence of the <hi>Major</hi> is as evident as reaſon can make it, unleſſe we make Chriſt to pray in vaine, to pray for that which was already done; if therefore they were not one in Chriſt, and the Father as the Father was in Chriſt, and Chriſt in the Father before, as this prayer intimates they were not, then this union was not antecedent to faith. The <hi>Minor</hi> are the words of Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 17.20, 21. and need not a graine of allowance; Chriſt in this place prayes for thoſe for whom he was to die, that after his death they might believe; the inſtrumentall cauſe of that faith, is ſet down to be the word of the Apoſtles; the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall cauſe of that believing, is, that they might be one, that is, that they might be as members of the ſame body by faith, near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly united to one another; the manner how is declared by the near conjunction between the Father and Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he prayes not only that they may be one, or at unity among themſelves,<note place="margin">Diodat <hi>in Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum.</hi> 171. John 21.</note> but alſo that they may be one in us; that is, as <hi>Diodat</hi> upon the place, in the communion of the Holy Ghoſt, by which they may be myſtically united to me, and by me to thee, (and truly this latter union to Chriſt is the ground of the former, of being united to one another;) now if they were myſtically united before, this would make Chriſt either ignorant of this union, or his prayer to be in vain, to pray for that that was done long before from eternity, (as Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> ſaith,) but either of theſe were fearful impiety to imagine, therefore this union is not till faith.</p>
               <p>A ſecond Argument I frame from the ſame place is this: They that are not really united as members of the inviſible Church to the reſt of the members, and myſticall body of Chriſt, are not united to Chriſt; But before faith, no man is a true member of the inviſible Church, and ſo united to the reſt of the members of the myſtical body; Therefore not to Chriſt. The <hi>Major</hi> will not be denied by any, but ſuch as are baptized into a ſpirit of errour; the Reaſon is plaine, becauſe the union between the members is a fruit of our union to the ſame Head; but no man is united to the company of Believers to have a true fellowſhip and union with them, but a true Believer; <hi>For what communion hath a Believer with an Infide?</hi> and Chriſt prayes that <hi>they might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that they might be one,</hi> that is, that they might be mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually

               <p n="3">3. <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Belial</hi> are not united: Every unbeliever is a ſon of <hi>Belial:</hi> Therefore they are not united.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 6.15.</note> The word <hi>Belial</hi> is as much as <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>; the Hebricians agree not from whence it is derived; but the ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification given is either a man that will profit none, or good for nothing, or one that will be ſubject to no yoke; I deny not but Interpreters do think many of them, that Satan is in this place underſtood, and <hi>Beza</hi> ſaith, it very well agrees to him, though he take it for a wicked man; and <hi>Bullinger</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> take it for the Devil, the head of all wicked men: but I ſee not why it may not be taken here for a wicked man, and not for Satan; for it's ordinary in Scripture by this word to underſtand very wicked men; ſo in <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> it's taken for an Idolater,<note place="margin">Deut. 13.13.</note> and of ſuch is the Apoſtles diſcourſing here, that Believers ſhould have no communion with Idolaters; and ſo <hi>Elies</hi> ſons being very wicked,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 2.12.</note> are called ſons of <hi>Belial.</hi> And it's very agreeable to the ſcope; for in the <hi>verſe</hi> before, he exhorteth them not to be unequally yoaked together with unbelievers; he blames them for having too much familiarity with Heathens, whether in marriages, or in their feaſts, eating things ſacrificed to Idols; he would not have them draw in the ſame yoke, by which Metaphor he would diſſwade them from keeping company with them, and ſo partak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them in their ſins. His Argument is drawn <hi>à contrario,</hi> Your condition and profeſſion is as contrary to theirs, as righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe is to unrighteouſneſſe, as light and darkneſſe; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as there is no fellowſhip between righteouſneſſe and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſſe, between light and darkneſſe, ſo neither ſhould there be between you and them; yea, Chriſt hath no communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

               <p>I will end all with <hi>CAMERO, Si quis ergo propriè loqui velit, dicet Chriſtum pro ſolis credentibus ſatisfeciſſe,</hi>

                  <hi>ii enim ſoli membra illius ſunt. Sicuti ergò</hi> Adam <hi>ſuos tantum peccato infecit, ita Chriſtus peccatum in ſuis tantùm abolevit, Chriſti verò membrum non eſt ullus, qui in Chriſtum non credit: Audi quid dicam, fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des te facit Christi membrum, at fides illa te non ſervàſſet niſi Christus pro te ſatisfeciſſet:</hi> If any man therefore will ſpeak properly, he will ſay, that Chriſt ſatisfied only for Believers, for they only are his members. Therefore even as <hi>Adam</hi> infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only his own with ſin, ſo <hi>Christ</hi> hath aboliſhed ſin only in his; but no man is a member of Chriſt, but he that beleiveth. Hear thou what I ſhall ſay, faith maketh thee a member of Chriſt, but that faith would not ſave thee, unleſſe Chriſt had ſatisfied for thee.</p>
               <p>To what hath been ſpoken, I ſhall ſuperadde ſome conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations about this union to Chriſt, taken from the ſeveral ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litudes, under which this union is ſet forth in Scripture.</p>
               <p>Firſt, It is compared to the Marriage-union; Now as before marriage, the wife hath no right nor title to the name, body, goods of the husband; ſo before faith, the ſoul hath nor that right to Chriſt, his Body, Name, Goods, Purchaſes: Therefore this union is not made till faith, and in this Mr, <hi>Eyre</hi> yields the cauſe, that the conjugal union is not till faith.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is expreſſed by a body conſiſting of divers mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; Now,<note place="margin">Rom. 12.4, 5.</note> as no member is a true and living member of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but that which by nearneſſe, and vital ligatures is united to the head, from whence every member receives ſtrength, and
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:118254:65"/> ſenſation;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.12, 13. Eph. 1.22, 23.</note> ſo no man is a living member of Chriſts body, untill by faith on his part, and by the Spirit as by vital ligatures he is bound and united to Chriſt, whereby he receives the life of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification and ſantificaction, and lives by a life derived from Chriſt as the Head; but no man but a Believer is thus united as an integral part of this body.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It's compared to a building or houſe, whoſe ſtones are cloſely cemented together, and do all lie directly and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicularly upon the foundation:<note place="margin">Eph. 2.2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, 21.</note> Now as a ſtone in the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is not united in the building, till it be hewen, and ſquared, and then by the hand of ſome Architect laid directly, and evenly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the foundation; ſo a man in his natural eſtate, till he be drawn out of this condition by the Spirit of God,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 3.15.</note> and hewed and ſquared out of the Spirit of bondage, and by the ſame hand of the Spirit, as the chief Maſter-builder brought to faith,<note place="margin">1 Pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. 2.5.</note> and built upon the foundation of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and <hi>Prophets, Jeſus Chriſt himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the chief corner-ſtone,</hi> he is not a lively ſtone in this building; this is done by the work of the Spirit, an unbeliever hath not the Spirit dwelling in him.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, it is compared to an ingrafture of a branch in a tree: Now a branch may be in a ſtock two wayes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By contiguity, or continuity, or corporal adherency to the ſtock, and ſo every branch that is dead may be in the tree, but theſe partake not of the juyce, and nouriſhmnt of the ſtock, and ſuch branches the husbandman will cut off, and caſt into the fire.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A branch is in the tree by a reall participation of the ſap, and influences of the root; Thus a man may be in Chriſt two wayes:</p>
               <p n="1">1. By external profeſſion of faith, (for that which maketh us to be in Chriſt, any kinde of way is faith;) now if our faith be a dead faith, ſuch as makes us come to Chriſt to ſhelter us from the fire only, and it derive not ſpiritual life and ſanctification from Chriſt; this man is a dead branch, which the Father will cut off, and caſt into the fire, if it ſo abide; and untill a true faith, ſuch as is peculiar to the Elect, all are but dead branches; yea,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:118254:65"/> the very Elect themſelves, untill effectual vocation, and were never truly in him.</p>
               <p>But, 2. There is a living, operative, precious, unfeigned faith, which ſo unites the ſoul to Chriſt, that now it partaketh of the power of his death; it is crucified with him, and dies to ſinne, and yet alſo it lives, and is partaker of the quickening Spirit and power of Chriſts Reſurrection, whereby it lives, and the life it lives in the fleſh, it lives by the faith of the Son of God,<note place="margin">Gal. 2.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>0.</note> and it lives unto God as its end, as well as from God as the principle of its life; this is the true branch, that partaketh of the ſap and influence of the Root Chriſt Jeſus unto a heavenly life; and none are ſuch branches, but ſuch as are truly cut off from the ſtock of Nature, and ingraffed by faith into Chriſt.</p>

<pb n="106" facs="tcp:118254:66"/> them Brethren; and ſuch as he calleth ſons, he doth not intend to call them ſo antecedently to their faith, but only to ſhew who ſhall be brought to glory by his death, and that is only ſonnes. And by Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi>'s leave, it is wholly excentrical to this place to compare Chriſt to the firſt-fruits, and thoſe for whom he died to the reſidue of the heap, as he doth in quoting that place.</p>

               <p>In the next place, I ſhall take notice of Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi>'s ſlight anſwer to the Reverend Mr. <hi>Conant</hi> ſince deceaſed, who as Moderator in our firſt Conference, propoſed the Objection drawn from <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.7.<note place="margin">Rom. 16.7.</note> where <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>Andronicus</hi> and <hi>Junia,</hi> ſaith, they were in Chriſt before me; but if this union be eternal, or antecedent to our birth and faith, one cannot be in Chriſt before another. He ſaith, he returned no anſwer, and the truth is, he can returne no ſolid anſwer. And though he now inſult ſince the deceaſe of this Reverend Servant of Chriſt, and ſaith, he paſſed it over, becauſe there was little difficulty in it; yet when he was living, he was no more able to ſtand againſt him in an Argument, then <hi>Dagon</hi> before the Arke, then <hi>Stephens</hi> adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:118254:66"/> who could not reſiſt the Spirit by which he ſpake. But let us conſider the force of his Anſwer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is evident</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the Apostle ſpeaketh not there of their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual union with Chriſt, which is inviſible to man, for God onely knoweth who are hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>; but of ſuch a being in Chriſt as is by external profeſſion, and Church-communion, in reſpect of which the whole viſible Church is called Chriſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 12.12. <hi>And hypocrites as well as the Elect are ſaid to be in Chriſt, and to be branches in him. And thus it is acknowledged, that one is in Chriſt before ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, according as they are called and converted, whether really or in appearance: It doth not follow that union to Chriſt is ſucceſſive, or that it is an act done in time depending upon conditions performed by men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His firſt Anſwer is, This is not meant of ſpiritual union with Chriſt; his reaſon is, becauſe that is inviſible to man.</p>
               <p>Firſt, This is over-boldly aſſerted, that he ſaith, it is evident that this is not meant of ſpiritual union with Chriſt, when there is nothing ſaid but what may rather evidence the contrary.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Either this was a true union, or they were but hypocrites; but it is too much raſhneſſe to ſay they were hypocrites.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They were ſuch as were of note among the Apoſtles, chief Evangeliſts; I think (at leaſt in the judgement of charity,) they ſhould be ſuch as were truly in Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Apoſtle indued with a great Spirit of diſcerning, judged them ſo; he ſaith, <hi>they were in Chriſt,</hi> therefore we ſhould judge it really.</p>
               <p n="4">4. 'Tis ſuch an union and in-being in Chriſt, as <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward had; but his union was real, he meant and underſtood a real union in reſpect of himſelf, and what he affirmes of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he ſaith the ſame of them, and that they had this priviledge to be in Chriſt before him.</p>
               <p n="5">5. This was no ſuch great priviledge, for the pen of an Apoſtle to commend them far above himſelf; if he thought only it was an union in profeſſion, in ſhew only, and not in truth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That which leads him to judge it was not a real ſpiritual union with Chriſt, is, becauſe this was inviſible to man; becauſe, ſaith he, <hi>God onely knowes who are his.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, 1. Might he not here well exempt the Apoſtles, who
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:118254:67"/> were by an extraordinary gift indued with a Spirit of diſcerning, and eſpecially were they guided in their Epiſtles written for a rule of life, whereof this is a part.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let it be granted for a truth, that no man can know infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly the Election, or regeneration of another, but by ſpecial Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation; then no man can abſolutely ſay of ſuch, who live holily in reſpect of converſation, whoſe actions are materially good, and nothing appearing to the contrary, but that they are in Chriſt really; none can ſay they are not in him really, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or ſuſpenſe of judgement had been better, then for him to ſay raſhly, it is evident the Apoſtle ſpeakes not of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall union with Chriſt, when he ſaith, theſe that were of chief note among the Apoſtles, were in Chriſt, and nothing appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the contrary. <hi>Malem Corberum metueret quàm haec inconſideratè diceret.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Doth not the Apoſtle judge of <hi>Apelles</hi> as a real Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian a little after, when he ſaith, he was approved in Chriſt; and of <hi>Ruſus,</hi> that he was choſen in the Lord? in the 12th. <hi>verſ.</hi> and was he guided by Revelation there, and not here? did not he elſewhere ſay of the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> that he knew their Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">1 Theſ. 1.4.</note> ſpeaking of them as of the better part, becauſe it is more then probable; where God will have his Word preached, there he hath ſome people; and St. <hi>John</hi> writing to a religious Lady, ſtiles her <hi>Elect,</hi> becauſe he had ſeen her and her children walk in the truth; and if theſe perſons were not known to be ſuch by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, yet had they ſtrong ground for a judgement of charity; and why we ſhould not look upon the union ſpoken of as reall or ſpiritual between them and Chriſt, I am yet to ſeek for a Reaſon.</p>
               <p>But further he ſaith, this is meant of a being in Chriſt by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal profeſſion, and Church-communion: but can he or any other ſay it is meant of no more?</p>
               <p n="2">2. From hence I gather, faith gives a real implantation; for if an hypocritical faith will give a man an external denomination of being in Chriſt, it is in the reſemblance it hath to true faith, and true faith muſt do more, or elſe an hypocrites faith were as good as the faith of an Elect perſon: Yea,</p>
               <p n="3">3. Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> acknowledgeth that one is in Chriſt before ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:118254:67"/> as he is called and converted really, or in appearance; if really converted, then really in Chriſt, then let us take it for granted, that <hi>Andronicus</hi> and <hi>Junia</hi> were in Chriſt really before <hi>Paul,</hi> then <hi>Paul</hi> was not in Chriſt; for if he were really in Chriſt, this cannot be true that they were really in Chriſt before him, for he was in Chriſt, and that really (according to Maſter <hi>Eyre</hi>) from eternity.</p>
               <p>But I deſire Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> to let us ſee the Scriptures, and hear his grounds for a twofold union to Chriſt, and both real unions, one from eternity, the other at converſion or faith, and if he prove it,

               <p>In the laſt place I ſhall now take notice of what he ſaith to that Logical Axiome, <hi>Non entis nulla ſunt accidentia,</hi> in his Book <hi>pag.</hi> 7. where I deſire the Reader to obſerve his miſtake, for I applied it to union with Chriſt, he to the imputed righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Chriſt. I ſaid that union with Chriſt, is a thing acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall to man, and that being an accident, requires that the ſubject united, of whom this is denominated that he is united to Chriſt, muſt be exiſtent, becauſe an accident cannot ſubſiſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out its ſubject; whether it be an accident by inheſion, or adheſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, both ſubſiſt dependently, and without the ſubject they ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt not; concerning union, he objecteth nothing from this Axi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ome, therefore I will hear what he ſaith concerning imputed righteouſneſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> He ſaith, <hi>It doth not follow that Chriſts righteouſneſſe cannot be imputed to us, before we have an actual created being, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe accidents cannot ſubſiſt without their ſubjects: For as much as imputed righteouſneſſe is not an accident inherent in us, and conſequently doth not require our exiſtence; Chriſt is the ſubject of this righteouſneſſe, and the imputation of it is an act of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> What if imputed righteouſneſſe be not an accident inherent, but an act of God; yet in relation to us, it is an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by extrinſecall denomination; and when it is imputed to us, it is terminated upon us, and we are denominated, and conſtituted righteous by it, and therefore it requires as much our exiſtence, as if it were an inherent accident; for can he be made righteous and truly denominated ſo, that is not a man, nor any thing <hi>in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:118254:68"/> naturâ?</hi> can any thing be predicated truly of that which is not? can <hi>Paul</hi> be ſaid to be learned, before he had a being? Surely this <hi>Axiome, Non entis nullae ſunt affectiones,</hi> will be an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaken truth when you and I ſhall ceaſe to ſpeak for it, or againſt it. I have ſpoken to the Logick of it, and Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> to the Divinity of it; and who ever read it, will finde it to be (as he hath juſtly ſtiled it) a very odde paſſage: only this I ſhall adde; We are ſpeaking of imputed righteouſneſſe, and he ſaith, Chriſt is the ſubject of it, if he mean of the righteouſneſſe imputed, he ſaith true; but if of the righteouſneſſe as imputed, it is a very odde paſſage indeed; for what need that to be imputed to Chriſt, which is ſubjectively inherent in him already; but take this righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe as imputed, and ſo we are the ſubjects recipient of it, or the objects upon whom it is terminated, and therefore it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily requires our exiſtence. Now to juſtifie the imputation of Chriſts righteouſneſſe to us before we have a being, he urgeth that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.17. that God calleth things that are not, as though they were: to this I ſhall give that anſwer which <hi>Davenant</hi> de morte Chriſti,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>pag.</hi> 61. puts into my mouth: <hi>Quanquam Deo quidem tanquam jam facta ſint, quae ille ut fiaent ab omni aeternitate diſpoſuit, nobis tamen non aliter accipienda ſunt, niſi ſecundùm modum illum diſpenſationis, quo ab aeterno decreta, &amp; in tempore complenda nobis &amp; in actum perducenda ſunt:</hi> Although truly to God thoſe things are as if they were now done, (becauſe nothing is paſt, preſent, and to come with him,) which he hath decreed that they ſhould be, and ordained them from all eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; yet to us they are not otherwiſe to be taken, then accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that manner of diſpenſation, wherein they were decreed and in time to be fulfilled to us, and to be brought into act.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mr</hi> Eyre objecteth further <hi>that the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt was actually imputed to the Patriarchs before it was wrought, and our ſins were actually imputed to Chriſt before they were committed; ſo I ſee no inconvenience to ſay that Chriſts righteouſneſſe is by God im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to the Elect before they have a being.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which I anſwer, there is not the like reaſon; for both the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, and the ſins of the Elect are both moral cauſes of their effects, which work according to the will and pleaſure of him that is moved thereby; hence God the Father is
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:118254:68"/> moved to give pardon to ſuch as believe, as an effect of Chriſts death, and it is at the will of God when to give it, therefore the effect ſometimes goes before the cauſe; as if a man promiſe to give a man five ſhillings for going ſo farre upon his errand, the man may give it before he hath taken a ſtep, though he give it only for that reaſon, here the effect goeth before the cauſe; and thus he gave pardon to ſuch as did believe in Chriſt before his death. Sometimes it followes after it, and not immediately al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes; thus God pardoneth us that believe, ſince the death of Chriſt, and that not from the time of Chriſts death, but it may be long after upon believing, and ſo our ſins were a moral cauſe of puniſhment; God might impute this to Chriſt before they are committed by us; for a morall cauſe will admit of the effect to go before it ſelf, that is the cauſe of it, and both the Patriarchs to whom Chriſts righteouſneſſe was imputed, and Chriſt to whom our ſins were imputed, were exiſtent; and the merit of the one, and demerit of the other may be communicated at the will of God moved thereby, becauſe there are ſubjects capable of this imputation; but now Chriſts righteouſneſſe which is imputed to us, cannot be imputed, for want of a ſubject to whom it may be imputed; for how can that which is not, be made righteous? and it is the will of God it ſhould be imputed to none but Believers; hence then till faith, this benefit is not enjoyed.</p>
               <p>Thus have I vindicated my ſecond argument, and for the third which he objecteth againſt, That God made a Covenant with Chriſt, that the Elect ſhould have no benefit by his death, till they believe, I have defended and confirmed that already ſufficiently. As for this Argument which he brought for the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, drawn from <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.17. <hi>This is my well beloved Sonne, in whom I am well pleaſed;</hi> I hope I have given a ſatisfactory an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to it already, and it is anſwer enough to deny his Aſſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as I then did, that this voice, <hi>This is my well beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed,</hi> was not terminated or ſpoken to Chriſt myſticall, but to Chriſt perſonal, yet as a publick perſon and Mediatour. And to make Chriſt myſtical, and Chriſt the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour the ſame, is unheard of Divinity; nor doth it ſpeak him any great <hi>Gamaliel</hi> in Theology that affirmeth it. As for the ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall he raiſeth upon me, that I compared my ſelf to Chriſt, and
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:118254:69"/> him to <hi>Judas,</hi> and uſed him uncivilly in language; I deny it, and have many to bear witneſſe of me to the contrary; and for the anſwer to it, I referre the Reader to the Epiſtle to the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: And I now ſhall addreſſe my ſelf to ſome ſhort anſwer to his Book, and as by the grace of Chriſt I have not hitherto (my conſcience bearing me witneſſe in the Holy Ghoſt) written any thing which I knew, or ſuſpected as unſound, ſo I truſt I ſhall not erre, or handle this ſubject deceitfully, but by manifeſtation of the truth, commend my ſelf to every mans conſcience, as in the ſight of God, to whom I commend thee, Religious Reader, and to the Word of his grace, who is able to build thee up, and give thee an inheritance among them that are ſanctified by faith in Chriſt.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Doctrine of Juſtification through Faith in Chriſt, is deſervedly ſtiled <hi>Doctrina ſtantis vel cadentis Eccleſiae,</hi> and therefore the differences amongſt Chriſtians in this point, are not of ſo ſmall concernment, as <hi>Curcellaeus</hi> judgeth, that they ought not to breed a Controverſie, for it is a fundamental Article of our Chriſtian Religion; yea, all Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion lives, or dies with it, nothing concernes the glory of God more, the honour of Chriſt, or the comfort of a Chriſtian, and ſuch goates as ſhall ſoile with their feet theſe waters,<note place="margin">Ezek. 34.18.</note> or with the <hi>Philistines</hi> throw dirt into this well, do at once ſtrike at the glory of God, the honour of Chriſt, the peace and ſafety of the world; and being commanded to contend earneſtly for the faith once delivered to the Saints, let not the world wonder, that I who am by Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> repreſented as Heterodox in this point, ſtand up both to defend it, and my ſelf againſt thoſe errours, wherewith he hath darkened and obſcured this bleſſed truth, and
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:118254:70"/> endeavoured to render me and his Brethren that diſſent from him, as thoſe that have overthrown the freeneſſe of Gods grace, in making Juſtification the effect of Faith, and Faith the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Covenant of Grace. The matters in controverſie depending between us may be reduced to four Heads, or unto four ſeverall Queſtions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Whether Juſtification be an immanent, or a tranſient act? whether it be from eternity, or a tranſient act of God done in time?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whether all the Elect for whom Chriſt died, be actually juſtified, and reconciled to God antecedently, not onely to their faith, but to their birth?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Whether a Believer be juſtified by faith inſtrumentally? and when the Scripture ſaith, <hi>we are juſtified by faith,</hi> whether this is underſtood only tropically, by taking faith for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, Chriſt? or whether it be taken ſubjectively for the act with connotation to the object?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Whether faith be the condition of the Covenant of Grace, God hath made with us?</p>
               <p>For the firſt Queſtion, Whether Juſtification be an immanent or tranſient act? whether we be juſtified from eternity, or whether it be a tranſient act of God done in time? Here are three termes to be explicated.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. What Juſtification is?</item>
                  <item>2. What an immanent act is?</item>
                  <item>3. What is meant by a tranſient act?</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. Then by all the Orthodox it is unanimouſly affirmed, that the word <hi>juſtifie,</hi> or <hi>juſtification,</hi> is not to be taken in this queſtion, <hi>ſenſu Pontificio,</hi> as the <hi>Papiſts</hi> take it, that is, <hi>ſenſu Phyſico,</hi> in a phyſical ſenſe, as if <hi>to juſtifie</hi> ſignified <hi>to make juſt</hi> by infuſion of an inherent righteouſneſſe, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and his confederates take it; for till <hi>Etymologies</hi> have gotten the ſupremacy above the Scriptures, as the Pope above the Kings of the Earth; and ſo long as the written Word is acknowledged the only Touchſtone of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Truth, and that Chriſts righteouſneſſe, and our works cannot be admitted as corrivals, that ſenſe muſt no way be acknowledged and received in this diſpute; yet let this be obſerved againſt this new Doctrine of Infidels Juſtification in the ſtate of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regeneracy;
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:118254:70"/> (though they remain adulterers, murtherers, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricides; yet if Elect, ſay they, they are juſtified even then, when they are in the ſnare of the Devil,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2.26. Eph. 2.2.</note> led captive by him at his will and pleaſure. Though they walk according to the courſe of the world, the Spirit that now worketh in the children of diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: for, Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> acknowledgeth <hi>he is well pleaſed with the unregenerate, though not with their unregeneracy.</hi> That GOD when he juſtifieth a man through the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, doth at the ſame time begin to juſtifie him phyſically, he doth infuſe an habituall and an inherent righteouſneſſe of Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication; for God juſtifieth none, whom he doth not ſanctifie at the ſame time.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Juſtification may be taken <hi>ſenſu forenſi,</hi> in a juri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical or judiciary ſenſe, as in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8 33. <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect? it is God that juſtifieth,</hi> Prov. 17.35. <hi>He that juſtifieth the wicked, and condemneth the juſt, they both are an abomination to the Lord.</hi> And ſo it is oppoſed to accuſation, or condemnation, and thus it is an act of God judicially decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a Believer to be innocent or righteous, and acquitting him from all blame and puniſhment. I need not ſpend time to open this, it is ſufficiently done already by our<note n="*" place="margin">Juſtificatio eſt ſententia Dei gratioſa, qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> propter Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtum fide appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſum abſolvit fidelem à pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to &amp; morte, &amp; juſtum reputat ad vitam. <hi>Ameſ.</hi> Medul. ch. <hi>27.</hi> ſect. <hi>6.</hi>
                  </note> Divines againſt the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts; Juſtification therefore is a gracious ſentence of God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, wherby for Chriſts ſake apprehended by faith, he doth ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve a ſinner from ſin and death, and doth eſteem him righteous unto eternal life. It is a ſentence pronounced, as the uſe of the word declares, which makes not a natural, but a moral change in the perſon juſtified; for it is not as <hi>Aquinas</hi> and his followers imagine, a phyſicall motion by a real tranſmutation from a ſtate of unrighteouſneſſe to a ſtate of righteouſneſſe; ſo as that the <hi>terme</hi> from which this motion is, ſhould be ſin, the <hi>terme</hi> unto which it tends, and ends in, ſhould be inherent righteouſneſſe, as if it ſtood partly in remiſſion, and partly in infuſion of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: What act this is, I will declare by and by; or let me deſcribe it thus with Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> It is an act of God the Father upon the Believer, whereby the debt and ſins of a Believer are charged upon the Lord Jeſus, and by the merits and ſatisfaction of Chriſt imputed, he is accounted juſt, and ſo is acquitted before God as righteous.</p>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:118254:71"/>
               <p>Firſt, It is an act of God the Father, a judicial act acquitting and abſolving the ſinner, and an act of God the Father, (not to exclude the Son and Holy Ghoſt;) for <hi>Opera Trinitatis ad extra ſunt indiviſa,</hi> The works of the Trinity terminated upon the creature, are communicable to all three perſons. For the Son and Holy Ghoſt were offended by mans ſin, as well as the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, being one and the ſame God with the Father; but it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led an act of the Father, and rightly applied to him, becauſe of that old and known rule among Divines, Whereſoever we finde the Name of God put in oppoſition to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> it muſt not be underſtood <hi>eſſentially,</hi> but <hi>perſonally:</hi> Hence when it's ſaid, God was in Chriſt reconciling the world unto himſelf, not imputing their ſins, and that God ſent forth him, to wit Chriſt, a propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation through faith in his blood, it muſt be underſtood of God the Father; and ſo, <hi>John</hi> 3.16. <hi>God ſo loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh, &amp;c.</hi> And plainly Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Father, forgive them, &amp;c. And Chriſt is an Advocate with the Father,</hi> 1 John 1.2. Now it is applied to the Father, becauſe the ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> was directly againſt the Fathers work, for <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t res ſe habent ad eſſe, ita ad operari,</hi> every thing doth work according to its being. Now the Father being the firſt perſon in the <hi>Trinity,</hi> he works in order firſt, and hence Creation is attributed to the Father, and Redemption at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the Son, and Sanctification to the Holy Spirit. Now <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne was directly againſt the Fathers work, for his work appeared in <hi>Adams</hi> Creation after the Image of God; therefore the Father being principally offended, forgives.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is an act of God the Father upon the Believer, therefore it was not an immanent, but is a tranſient act done in time; for a man is not a man, much leſſe a Believer from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; and what this act is, I ſhall here a little explain.</p>
               <p>It is ſome act of God done upon believing, and never till then, for although we acknowledge no new imm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nent act in God, which cannot be admitted without a change in God, with whom there can be no variableneſſe, nor the leaſt ſhadow of turning; yet a tranſient act may be ſafely acknowledged, which leaves a change upon the creature, and not in God.</p>
               <p>And here I willingly acknowledge we are all much in the dark,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:118254:71"/> not being able to underſtand how God doth act or work, and therefore would not over-confidently aſſert how he doth it, or what that tranſient act is; but when God worketh faith, I am ſure there is a morall change wrought in the ſinner; there is not only a new relation put upon the ſinner, but a reall righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is imputed; yea, a phyſical change is wrought at the ſame time, for all grace habitually is infuſed together with faith,</p>
               <p>And I willingly acknowledge this tranſient act of God doth preſuppoſe an immanent act in God, for he worketh nothing upon the creature, but what he firſt purpoſed in himſelf to act; and God doth upon believing actually remit ſins, and accept as righteous the perſon that believeth, which termes of remitting ſin, not imputing it, or imputing righteouſneſſe, though they ſound as immanent acts, yet are to be ſenſed as tranſient, becauſe done in time, and leaving a reall change upon the creature, and it is utterly impoſſible that any new act of underſtanding, or will ſhould be in God, unleſſe therefore with <hi>Vorstius</hi> we aſſert the mutability of God, which is horrible blaſphemy to imagine, we cannot acknowledge any new immanent act in him. And the truth is; we muſt with ſobriety ſit down, and count it know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge enough to know what is written, and be contented that an infinite God ſhould do ſomething<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which our finite under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings cannot comprehend; for if he ſhall act or do nothing, but we muſt know how it is done, and why, this is to make God finite and not infinite. And to give in the utmoſt of my thoughts in this, I conceive the caſe is in this tranſient act of forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, as in the creation of the world; God did do that which he did not do before, but he did not then begin to have a will to create; but he willed from eternity that the world ſhould exiſt in time, as an effect of that will it was made, whether by an exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive power diſtinct from that will, I dare not determine; but made it was, and was not from eternity, and here is a new rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto God, he is a Creatour that before was not, this is but a relative reſpect, and an extrinſecal denomination, and there is no intrinſecall mutation in God, but a great change is wrought; for that that was not, now is.</p>
               <p>So when God forgiveth a ſinner upon believing, God doth do that which he did not do before; he doth not begin upon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev ng
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:118254:72"/> to have a will to pardon him, but he willed from eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to give him faith, and forgiveneſſe of ſins upon believing; now in time the ſinner elected is brought to faith, and the ſinner is actually and formally diſcharged, according to the tenor of the New Covenant, for the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and applied by faith, not by any new act of Gods will; I dare not determine, but pardoned he is, and juſtified he is, his ſtate is truly changed, and that <hi>coram Deo,</hi> in the ſight of God, and a new relative relation there is in God to this perſon, as a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; a great change wrought in the ſinner, but none at all in God; and the Believer is the ſubject, upon whom this act of God paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth,<note place="margin">Acts 13.39. Acts 16.31. Rom. 4.24. John 8.24. John 3.36, 16. John 17.20.</note> he is the adequate ſubject of it; for all Believers are thus juſtified, and none but Believers. God did not will that our ſins ſhould be immediately forgiven, but mediately by faith, as in <hi>John</hi> 3.16. Gods end in giving Chriſt, was that only. Believers ſhould have benefit by his death; and <hi>John</hi> 17.20. Chriſt pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for them that believe on him; and ſurely he had the ſame intentions in his death that he had in his interceſſion. And I added that the ſinnes of Believeres were laid upon Chriſt; thus Chriſt was made ſin for us,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.21. Iſa. 53.16.</note> that knew no ſin, and the Lord laid upon him the iniquities of us all, and by the merits and ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt imputed we are accounted juſt, and ſo are acquitted before God as righteous: Hence God is ſaid to be in Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling the world to himſelf, not imputing their tranſgreſſions to them,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.</note> and we are ſaid to be juſtified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Jeſus,<note place="margin">Rom. 3.24, 25. 1 Cor. 1.30.</note> 
                  <hi>Whom God hath ſet forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood:</hi> And, <hi>Christ is made to us righteouſneſſe, wiſdome, ſanctification, and redemption.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall now come to enquire what is meant by an immanent act, and whether Juſtification were from eternity, and what is meant by a tranſient act.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Then by an immanent act, I underſtand ſuch an act, as is terminated <hi>in agente,</hi> in the agent, and not in any thing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it. There are ſome actions which do remain in God, and are terminated in himſelf, being confined in his own breaſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the compaſſe of his own underſtanding and will; not but that they may have an external object, but nothing in theſe immanent
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:118254:72"/> acts hath any thing without them for the ſubject or <hi>terme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for example, a man may purpoſe and intend to do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in his minde and heart, as to relieve a poor mans wants; this thought and purpoſe of heart is an immanent action, and ſo long as it remaines in his minde and breaſt, and he reveal it not, and do not yet act accordingly, this is yet an immanent action, and the poor man is not yet actually the better for it; but if he declare his minde, and doth practiſe what he intended, here is a tranſient act, for now he doth outwardly expreſſe and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme what he did inwardly purpoſe: Now the poor man is comforted, and his wants actually relieved; Let us referre this to God, there are ſome Cabinet, ſecret thoughts, and purpoſes in God from eternity, about juſtifying a ſinner through the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt apprehended and applied by faith, which Chriſt God will prepare and give to procure a ſufficient righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, and will alſo give faith to the ſinner, to believe on Chriſt for ſalvation; Such thoughts as theſe are, were in the minde of God from eternity; theſe thoughts were immanent acts in God, and work no preſent change upon the ſinner, who had no being from eternity; and untill God do actually declare, and fulfill the thoughts of his heart, the ſinner is not juſtified, but only God really intends it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, There are actions in God which paſſe from God upon the creature, and do work a change and alteration upon the creature, and theſe we call tranſient actions; when therefore God doth not only declare by his Goſpel, what his thoughts were to his Elect in pardoning them through faith in Chriſt, but doth in time give Chriſt for them, and them to Chriſt, by draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their hearts unto Chriſts by faith; now God actually per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes the thoughts of his heart, and as he intended upon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving to juſtifie them for Chriſts ſake, ſo now as ſoon as he hath brought them to faith, he doth actually forgive them all their ſins, juſtifie their perſons, and accept them as righteous in Chriſt. Now of this ſort are all Gods actions that relate to man, except Predeſtination, which is an immanent act of God; and all the reſt; Juſtification, Sanctification, Adoption, are tranſient acts of God: for all theſe imply a poſitive change in
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:118254:73"/> the creature, and do put ſomething, either phyſically, or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally into the juſtified, adopted, ſanctified, &amp;c. But concerning Predeſtination, <hi>Tritum eſt in Scholis, eam nihil ponere in Praedeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to;</hi> It is generally received by the Schoolmen, that Predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion puts nothing into the predeſtinate, or makes no preſent change (indeed virtually it is the cauſe of all thoſe tranſient acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that are done in time). And<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Aquin.</hi> p. 1. q. 13. artic. 2. c.</note> 
                  <hi>Aquinas</hi> gives a reaſon of it; <hi>Quia Praedeſtinatio eſt pars Providentiae, Providentia verò non eſt in rebus proviſis, ſed eſt quaedam ratio in intellectu proviſoris;</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Predeſtination is a part of Divine Providence: Now Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence is not in the things foreſeen, or provided for; but is a certain purpoſe, or counſel in the underſtanding of the foreſeer. And hence all our Divines are wont cautelouſly to diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>decree</hi> and the <hi>execution</hi> of the <hi>decree;</hi> they grant the Decree hath no cauſe but the free will and wiſe prudence of God; but the Execution of the Decree depends upon faith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Pardon, Reconciliation, is granted to none but Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers.</p>
               <p>Let me adde in the third place, that an immanent action is from eternity, and is the ſame with Gods Eſſence; for whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is in God, is God, but a tranſient action is the ſame with the effect produced: Hence Gods Decrees are, as Mr. <hi>Burgeſſe</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Mr. <hi>Burgeſſe,</hi> Juſtifi. p. 168.</note> rightly obſerves, the ſame with his nature; for an act of Gods un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding or will, is not any thing diſtinct from his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding or will, but the very ſame with it.<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Scheib.</hi> Met, l. 2. ca. 3. <hi>De Deo.</hi> p. 137.</note> 
                  <hi>Actus vitales Dei, ut eſt ejus intellectio, &amp; volitio, habent ibi realem identita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem ad eſſentiam divinam;</hi> All vital actions in God, as his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and will are, have a reall identity, or ſameneſſe with his Divine Eſſence, for otherwiſe the ſimplicity of Gods nature would be overthrown: therefore though we may conceive di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly of them, yet they are not really diſtinguiſhed in God. But now in tranſient actions it is otherwiſe, for they are the ſame with the effect produced;<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> will have it to be an immanent acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on done from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, not a tranſient act done in timo.</note> Gods tranſient act in creating, is Creation, and in juſtifying, is Juſtification. By this that hath been ſaid, it appeareth that Juſtification is a tranſient, not an immanent action. For though I deny not that God did from eternity, with an abſolute, fixed, and immutable will, purpoſe
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:118254:73"/> in time to juſtifie his people through faith in Chriſt, which faith he will alſo give, and Chriſt did merit; and if this will ſatisfie Mr. <hi>Eyre,</hi> as he ſaith it will, if he be not a <hi>Reuben,</hi> as unſtable as water, and fall from his word, the controverſie is at an end.]</p>
               <p>Yet this is not Juſtification, no more then Gods purpoſe to ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie is Sanctification, as ſhall be made to appear in its place; Juſtification leaveth a poſitive change upon the perſon juſtified, <hi>He is thereby paſſed from death to life,</hi> from a ſtate of hatred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a ſtate of love and friendſhip; but an immanent act leaveth no ſuch change, nor do I mean with <hi>Aquinas</hi> and the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> a phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call change; as when the Lord makes a wicked man, a holy man; an unclean man, a chaſte man; a paſſionate man, a meek man; this is a naturall change, and is the work of Sanctification; but it is a relative and morall change. Take a man that is in priſon for ſome capitall offence, and alſo exceeding ſick, a double change may be wrought upon this man: Firſt, let his offence be forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and he ſet at liberty, he is now a free man, acquitted, and ſet at liberty, that before was in bond, a dead man; here is a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive change, but he may be as ſick ſtill as he was, when in priſon; let the Phyſician come and heal his diſtemper, here is a cure wrought, his health reſtored, this is a natural, phyſical change; ſo it is here upon Juſtification, there is a relative change wrought; <hi>We that were debtors to the Law, and liable to death and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, our ſin through faith in Chriſt is pardoned,</hi> now we are acquitted and ſet free from condemnation, here is a change of our eſtate; but then alſo by Sanctification the Lord heales our natures. Now Juſtification is a tranſient act of God in time up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Believer, acquitting him for Chriſts ſake from the guilt of ſin, and through his righteouſneſſe imputed, he is accepted unto life eternall.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Queſtion is, Whether all the Elect for whom Chriſt died, be actually reconciled, and juſtified from the time of Chriſts death, antecedently not only to their faith, but their birth alſo?</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is not denied upon neither hand, that the Elect are the perſons, and the only perſons for whom Chriſt intentionally and effectually died.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:118254:74"/>2. It is not denied that the death of Chriſt is the meritorious cauſe of ſalvation, and that a full ſatisfaction was made thereby to the juſtice of God for the ſins of the Elect.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is acknowledged that Chriſt in his death was a common perſon, making ſatisfaction for the Elect, and ſuch as ſhall believe; and by vertue of Chriſts death they ſhall infallibly be brought to faith, and that God hath thus farre accepted of this ſatisfaction, as that he neither will, nor can require any thing more at the hand of the ſinner by way of ſatisfaction, nor at the hands of Chriſt, and that in regard of the price paid we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It will not be denied but that by the death of Chriſt God may now freely give us the pardon of ſins, which without the ſatisfaction of Chriſt, ſuppoſing his eternal decree not to pardon us without a ſatisfaction, he could not do.</p>
               <p n="5">5. We deny not but Chriſts Reſurrection from the dead, was a manifeſt ſigne, that the full price of redemption was paid, and that God gave him a publick diſcharge from the guilt of our ſins, and that he roſe again as a publick perſon for our juſtification, that we may be ſaid virtually to die, and ſuffer, and riſe with him, and virtually to be juſtified in his juſtification. But it is denied by us, and affirmed by Mr. <hi>Eyre,</hi> that we ſtand actually juſtified, and reconciled to God from the time of Chriſts death antecedently to our faith and birth, and that it was the will of the Lord to give us a preſent diſcharge from the time of Chriſts death, but God hath limited the benefit of this untill faith: So that no perſon in the ſtate of unbelief and unregeneracy, is a ſubject of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; this we affirme, and Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> denies, who will have all the Elect, though Infidels, and in their unregenerate eſtate, under the power and dominion of ſin to be actually juſtified.</p>
               <p>The third queſtion is, Whether a believer be juſtified by faith inſtrumentally? and when the Scripture ſaith, <hi>we are justified by faith,</hi> whether this be underſtood tropically by taking faith for the object Chriſt, excluding the act, or whether it be taken pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly for the act with connotation of the Object.</p>
               <p>Now here firſt it is agreed upon all hands, by <hi>Preteſtants</hi> and <hi>Pàpiſts, Orthodox</hi> and <hi>Socinians, Antinomians, Remonſtrants</hi> and

               <p>Firſt, What is the Covenant of Grace?</p>
               <p>The Covenant of Grace, is that free gracious Covenant of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, which God of his meer mercy in Jeſus Chriſt made with man fallen into ſin and miſery, wherein he hath promiſed pardon of ſin, and eternall happineſſe by Chriſt, upon conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that he<note n="*" place="margin">Mark. 16.15, 16. John 3.16. Rom. 10.6, 9, 10. Gal. 3.11.</note> believe in Chriſt, promiſing alſo to give unto all thoſe that are<note n="*" place="margin">Acts 13.48. John 6.44.</note> ordained unto life, his Holy Spirit to inable them to believe, and ſo <hi>He will be their God, and they ſhall be his people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Covenant of grace under the Old and New Teſtament, is for ſubſtance one and the ſame under various diſpenſations.<note n="*" place="margin">Gal 3.16, 17.</note> The diſtance between God and man is ſo great; that although the reaſonable creature do owe obedience to his Creator, yet he could never have God obliged to him to give him fruition of himſelf, and eternal happineſſe, but by ſome voluntary act of condeſcenſion on Gods part, which is expreſſed by way of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; there is not therefore a mutual obligation of debt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and man, for that is founded on equality; but there is no ſuch equality between God and the creature, much leſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and the ſinner; it is therefore a free Covenant that God maketh with man, and of his abundant rich grace in Chriſt. The Author of this Covenant is God, our merciful Father in Chriſt-Jeſut; the impulſive moving cauſe from within, was his own free love; the outward moving cauſe was mans miſery, and Chriſts merits:<note place="margin">Ezek. 16.6.</note> 
                  <hi>When I paſſed by thee, I ſaw thee polluted in thy own blood, I ſaid unto thee, live.</hi> The fall of man was the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of this Covenant; God permitted man to fall, that he might ſhew the abundant riches of his mercy in our redemption. For mercy might have freed us from miſery by preventing our fall; but the exceeding abundance of Gods rich mercy, is more ſeen in recovering us out of the miſery into which we were fallen. And the grace of God was much ſeen in the time of giving this Covenant at the very fall, before judgement was given upon the delinquents, that they might not be ſwallowed up with wrath, and before Satan had made too great a waſte upon the creation, and eſpecially upon man drawn by his temptation into condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation with himſelf.</p>

The reaſon which they alledge is, becauſe if it be meant of Chriſt perſonally conſidered, ſo it would not agree with the ſcope of <hi>Paul,</hi> who proveth that life eternal is promiſed to all Believers. 2.

                     </gap>.</note> Mr. <hi>Rutherford,</hi> this is not ſure; for the truth is, the promiſe is not made to Chriſts perſon ſingly conſidered, nor to Chriſt myſtical: For, 1.

In whom we receive the Promiſe of the Spirit through faith, <hi>verſ.</hi> 15. Who was made a curſe for us, <hi>ver.</hi> 13. Now, not any of theſe can agree to Chriſt myſtical; Chriſt myſticall did not confirme the Covenant, nor give the Spirit, nor was he made a curſe: but Chriſt Mediatour is he to whom the promiſes are made, and in him to all his heirs and kindred, not ſimply in his perſon, but as a publick perſon, and Mediatour; and upon believing we are truly in him, and ſo <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, and ſo heires according to the promiſe. And here it will be good to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the relations of Chriſt to this Covenant: 1.<note place="margin">Heb. 8.6.</note> As he is the middle perſon between contrary parties, he is the Mediator of the Covenant. 2. As he dealeth between both parties,<note place="margin">Mal. 3.1. Heb. 7.22.</note> he is <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuncius,</hi> the Meſſenger of the Covenant. 3. As he undertaketh for the parties at variance, he is the ſurety of the Covenant.

As he ſigneth the Covenant, and confirmeth it with his blood, he is the Teſtatour of the Covenant. 5. As he ſaw, and heard, and teſtifieth all that the Father hath promiſed to belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, he is the witneſſe of the Covenant.</p>
               <p>Now as the Covenant was made with Chriſt in the behalf of the Elect, yet it followeth not they were in Covenant before they believe, for God Covenanted with Chriſt to be their God that ſhall believe in him; hence untill we believe, we are not actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in Covenant with God; and Chriſt contracted with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, not only to die for us, but to bring us to faith; he is a ſurety to ſee the condition of the Covenant performed on our part; and therefore we muſt be brought to faith before God is properly ſaid to be in Covenant with us, and faith then is the condition of the Covenant in reference unto us.</p>
               <p>Now in what ſenſe faith is the condition of the Covenant, I ſhall here explaine.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Faith is not the condition of the Covenant in a Popiſh ſenſe, as if by the performing this condition of believing we did merit, and earn eternal life, and ſalvation were the wages of faith, and God <hi>ex debito</hi> bound to give it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Faith is not an <hi>Antecedaneous</hi> condition,<note n="*" place="margin">Dicunt noſtri fidem non eſſe conditionemmo ventem Dei vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntatem, &amp; ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſalutem no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtram eſſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionatam quod eſt veriſſimum; nam Deus non vult nobis aliam vitam quàm quae antecedanem habet fidem, &amp; tamen nullo modo movetur Dei voluntas à fide noſtrâ. <hi>Ruth.</hi> Apol.

                  </note> moving God to give Chriſt to redeem us, and to propound the Goſpel to us, as if God did not, or could not propound the Covenant of Grace to us, nor offer the Covenant to us till we believe; the price of redemption was paid without any condition that it ſhould be paid, though not without a condition for the applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, We do not underſtand faith a condition in an <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> ſenſe; for ſuch a condition by way of contract and bargaine, by a free voluntary act of our own, performed by the power of free-will, withour the <hi>predeterminating</hi> and aſſiſting grace of Chriſt, by vertue of which God is oblidged to ſave us, and give us the benefits of the Covenant. We take it not in ſuch a juridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call ſenſe, as the Juriſts do, for a condition in a ſtrict proper ſenſe, upon which the benefits of the Covenant depend; nor do
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:118254:77"/> we take it in that manner, as the firſt Covenant did, that as our workes perſonally performed by us in obedience to the whole Law, were the condition of the Covenant, and the matter of our righteouſneſſe, that ſo the <hi>Tò credere,</hi> or act of believing performed by us, ſhould ſtand inſtead of the righteouſneſſe of the Law, in whole as the <hi>Arminians,</hi> and in part as the <hi>Papiſts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But we take faith for a condition in this ſenſe, for an Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call qualification wrought in us by the grace of Chriſt, without which we are not juſtified nor ſaved, and ſhall not enjoy the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits and bleſſings of the new Covenant, as a cauſe of life, not efficiently, as works in the old Covenant, but inſtrumentally by applying by Gods order and conſtitution Chriſt and his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits to the Believer: And thus the Scripture ſaith, <hi>He that believeth ſhall be ſaved, he that believeth not ſhall be damned, and that the wrath of God abideth on him</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">There it was, and there it ſhall reſt, till by faith it be removed.</note>; works are required as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of thoſe that ſhall be ſaved, but faith is a condition of Juſtification. And becauſe this faith is freely given, ſalvation is no leſſe of free grace, then if this condition were not required; nor is it abſurd that the ſame thing ſhould be freely promiſed of God, and yet required as a duty of us; 'tis we are bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and repent, and yet faith is Gods gift, and Chriſt is exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a Prince and a Saviour to give repentance unto his people for remiſſion of ſins.</p>

                  </note> as well as diſagreeing from the truth; ſuch in this Chapter ſhall the Reader finde Mr <hi>Eyre,</hi> (ſo farre as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to his Book) I truſt in Chriſt to manifeſt; and therefore let the judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Reader obſerve and judge. Now for his opinion, as farre as I can gather from his Book, I conceive it to be this:</p>
               <p>Firſt, He ſaith that Juſtification in Scripture is taken variouſly, <hi>pro volitione Divinâ, &amp; pro re volità.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>For the will of God not to puniſh, or impute ſinne unto his people:</hi> And,</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>For the effect of Gods will, to wit, his not puniſhing, or his
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:118254:78"/> ſetting of them free from the curſe of the Law; that is, Juſtification is taken by him actively,</hi> for Gods eternal will not to puniſh, and paſſively for the effect of that will, as it is terminated upon the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, or Believer. And he ſaith, <hi>that he looks upon Dr</hi> Twiſſe<hi>'s judgment as moſt accurate, who placeth the very eſſence and quiddity of Juſtification in the will of God not to puniſh.</hi> Wherein firſt let the Reader obſerve his departing from the received judgement of all Orthodox Divines, except three or four, in making Gods e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal will to be that wherein the Eſſence of Juſtification conſiſts; it is well known that unanimouſly they agree, that Juſtification is not an immanent, but a tranſient act done in time: And the Scripture no where calleth Gods eternal will Juſtification; and if the eſſence and quiddity of Juſtification conſiſt in this, it is mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell the Scripture ſhould never call it ſo; and ſo often as the Scripture ſpeaks of Juſtification, ſhould ſpeak of it in an improper ſenſe, paſſively taken, as terminated upon us. Beſides, the will of God not to puniſh, is but <hi>terminus diminuens,</hi> a decree, or will not to puniſh in time. Beſides, this is not the whole of Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, for it is a will, not to puniſh according to the tenor of the Goſpel and Covenant of Grace, which requireth faith. But I ſhall argue againſt this in a more proper place.</p>
               <p>Now if we take it thus, as Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> will have it, his opinion is this:</p>
               <p>Juſtification is an eternall immanent act, or will in God not to puniſh, and impute ſin unto his people, antecedently not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to their birth and faith, but to the death of Chriſt; nor is the death of Chriſt the cauſe of this Juſtification, (though with him Juſtification thus taken, is moſt accurate, and properly taken,) and ſo he maketh Chriſt no cauſe of the act of Juſtification, for he will acknowledge no other tranſient act, and immanent there is none.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>And this act is not purely</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Page</hi> 67.</note> 
                  <hi>negative, as the non-imputation of ſin to a ſtone, but privative, being the non-imputation of a ſin realiter futuri ineſſe,</hi> which how Scholaſtically it is ſpoken? (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a privative act of a privation in <hi>a poſitive</hi> decree of God, when neither the ſubject nor the ſin are in being; and as if ſin were <hi>debitum ineſſe,</hi> that that ought to be in us, for privation is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly underſtood of theſe.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:118254:79"/>2. <hi>And this non-imputation is actual, though the ſin not to be imputed be not in actual being;</hi> [a will not to impute it hereafter, may be actual, but to call that an actuall non-imputation, is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly ſpoken.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>This act of juſtifying is compleat in it ſelf, for God by his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal and unchangeable will not imputing ſin to his Elect, none can im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute it, &amp;c.</hi> Here is a compleat Juſtification then without a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, for which <hi>Socinus</hi> will give him the right hand of fellowſhip, and many thanks for a gratuity.</p>
               <p>And yet he addeth, <hi>that this renders not the death of Chriſt uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe,</hi> ſurely as to this act it is uſeleſſe<note n="*" place="margin">And Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> acknowledgeth no other act of Juſtification.</note>; and if it be the merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious cauſe of the effects of this Juſtification, how was that Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation compleat, whoſe effects could not be obtained without the death of the Son of God? Where let the Reader obſerve alſo, that he maketh Chriſt no more the cauſe of Juſtification, then of Election, for he addeth by way of ſimilitude, <hi>As the love of God is compleat in it ſelf, but yet Chriſt is the meritorious cauſe of all the effectt of it;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. <hi>67.</hi> and ſo Pag. <hi>66.</hi> As electing love precede, &amp;c.</note> ſo this act of juſtifying is compleat in it ſelf, but yet Chriſt is the meritorious cauſe of all the effects of it.</p>
               <p>Moreover he ſaith, <hi>That the Lord did not impute ſin to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, when he purpoſed in himſelf not to deal with them according to their ſins, when the Father and the Son agreed upon that ſure and everlaſting Covenant,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Page</hi> 64.</note> 
                  <hi>that his Elect ſhould not bear the puniſhment which their ſins ſhould deſerve.</hi> Surely the Lord muſt then by Mr. <hi>Eyre impute it to Chriſt,</hi> and ſo Chriſt was man, and a ſinner from eternity, and crucified from eternity, and all this in Gods minde, and there <hi>Judas</hi> and <hi>Pilate,</hi> and thoſe that murdered Chriſt did exiſt too, and what will not this bring in? And<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Mr.</hi> Eyre, <hi>p.</hi> 8.</note> the ground of this is, that he conceives God conſtituting, and ordaining Chriſt a Head, and the Elect his Members, they were by this myſtically implanted before they were borne, even from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And Juſtification thus taken,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>makes no change in God,</hi> nor yet if it be acknowledged a tranſient act,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mr.</hi> Eyre, <hi>p.</hi> 65.</note> would it make a change in him, it would adde a relative reſpect, and an extrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecall denomination; and ſo in making it an immanent act, there muſt be a new relation of the perſon juſtified to God; but he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, it maketh a great change, if you take it for the delivery of
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:118254:79"/> the ſinner from the curſe of the Law. Surely he that is not, is not capable of an actual change, which you muſt hold, or your juſtification is not compleat, becauſe the deliverance is not a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent deliverance.</p>
               <p>Secondiy, Let us come to his paſſive Juſtification: <hi>If Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>be taken as moſt commonly it is, for the thing willed by this immanent act of his, to wit, our diſcharge from the Law, and deliverance from puniſhment; ſo it hath for its adequate cauſe and principle the death and ſatisfaction of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And thus by his death he obtained in behalf of the Elect, not a remote poſſible conditional reconciliation, but an actual and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate reconciliation.</hi> Where he aſcribeth a meritoriouſneſſe to the death of Chriſt in reſpect of the deliverance, but not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of any act of Gods deliverance, as if we could be juſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>fied, and none to juſtifie; for in the ſame place he denieth Chriſts death to be the cauſe of Gods will not to puniſh, (and that juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) and yet he will not acknowledge another act, as we do, a tranſient act of God, whereof Chriſts death is the cauſe, and yet ſome act he muſt finde out, or we cannot be juſtified.</p>
               <p>Now his opinion from hence is this, <hi>That Chriſt at his death ſtanding as a common perſon, and repreſenting all the Elect who were mystically united to him, he by his death gave full ſatisfaction to divine juſtice, by which they ſatisfied in him, and in his Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction receiving a publick diſcharge for himſelf and them, and they are now actually and formally reconciled and in favour with God, even while they remaine unregenerate perſons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherein in two things he differs from us, and departs from the truth.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In holding a myſtical union between Chriſt and the Elect before faith.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In that he ſaith that from the time of Chriſts death all the Elect are actually reconconciled, both theſe I have already diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved in the Vindication of my Sermon, but ſhall adde ſome arguments in its place againſt the latter.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, When it's ſaid we are juſtified by faith, he taketh it altogether objectively; He ſaith, Faith is taken objectively, for Chriſt and his righteouſneſſe juſtifieth in the ſight of God; if taken for the act, it only evidenceth juſtification, <hi>page</hi> 76. as
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:118254:80"/> if by faith were meant <hi>Chriſt,</hi> excluding faith from any hand in Juſtification, which if it were the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> meaning, he might have put in the Name <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and left out Faith, and his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing had been more plaine, which in this weighty controverſie of Juſtification, (though the Trope be more elegant) had been more needful: And in many places where he ſpeaketh of Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he expreſſely ſetteth down Chriſt as the object of our faith, and yet addeth faith, as that grace by which this object is appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended.</p>
               <p>Let us take that place in <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.15, 16. <hi>We who are Jewes by nature, and not ſinners of the Gentiles, Knowing that a man is not juſtified by the works of the Law, but by the faith of Jeſus Chriſt: even we have believed in Jeſus Chriſt, that we might be juſtified by the faith of Chriſt, and not by the wo ks of the Law.</hi> Here the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles Scope is to ſhew, that the believing Jewes (into which num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber he puts himſelf, and <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi>) ſeeing that they could not be juſtified by the Law, did for this end that they might be juſtified, believe on Chriſt, that they might be juſtified by the faith of Chriſt, where he makes Chriſt and his righteouſneſſe the object of faith, and the matter of their Juſtification; and he expreſſeth how Chriſts become theirs by faith, and it were a ſenſeleſſe interpretation to take Faith for Chriſt, and not for the Grace of Faith; as if the meaning ſhould be, that they were juſtified by the Chriſt of Chriſt, where he muſt exclude Chriſt or Faith, for one is redundant; nor doth the Apoſtle mean this of a declarative Juſtification, for then there is no reaſon nor tru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>h in it; for to ſay, that the workes of the Law may not evidence our Juſtification, theſe being as able to declare it as faith, as it is ſaid, <hi>Little children, let no man deceive y u: he that doth righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe,</hi>

                  <hi>is righteous;</hi> that is, is declared thereby to be righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Beſides, to make <hi>Paul</hi> to ſay, that <hi>they believed that they might be juſtified,</hi> that is, that they may know by believing that they had been juſtified before, had been to make the Apoſtle reaſon at a very low ebbe, as if the doing a thing for a certaine end, were a certain means to aſſure that the end hath been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained already. Beſides, it deſtroyes the Scope of the Apoſtles Argument, in reproving <hi>Peter</hi> for his diſſimulation; building up that in his Practice, which in his Doctrine he did deſtroy; the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:118254:80"/> Jewes thought the obſervation of the Law neceſſary to ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and hence made conſcience of keeping company with Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, and eating things forbidden by the Law; but <hi>Peter</hi> and the reſt of the Apoſtles knew, that a man is not juſtified by the works of the Law, and therefore did renounce hopes of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by that, and believe in Chriſt for Juſtification, and this he taught; <hi>And when he came to Antioch, before certain Jewes came down from James,</hi> he uſed his Chriſtian liberty, and did eat with the Gentiles; <hi>but when they were come down, he withdrew himſelf;</hi> he ſeparates from the Gentiles, by which practice he did as it were teach a necceſſity of keeping the Law as neceſſary to ſalvation: Now <hi>Paul</hi> blames his practice, that when he knew a man is not juſtified by the Law, but by faith in Chriſt, he did yet in practice hold up the neceſſity of the obſervation of the Law; ſo that the Apoſtle is not ſpeaking how a man may know his ſalvation, but how ſalvation is obtained. So the Apoſtle ſpeaking of the righteouſneſſe by which we muſt be juſtified, in <hi>Rom</hi> 3.11. ſaith,<note place="margin">Rom. 3.11.</note> it is a righteouſneſſe witneſſed by the Law and the Prophets, even a righteouſneſſe that is of God, which is by faith of Jeſus Chriſt; where by Faith, is neceſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And he takes the condition as a part of the Covenant, becauſe promiſed; ſo, that believing with him is a conſequent of the Covenant, not antecedent to it; where he wholly departeth from the received truth of Chriſt, and ſpeaketh that which is as contrary to the Scripture, as darkneſſe is to light.</p>
               <p>For, 1. He deſtroyes the nature of a Covenant which is, and neceſſarily requires a mutual ſtipulation, elſe it may be a promiſe, but no Covenant.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Salvation is undoubtedly a fruit of the Covenant, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faith there is no ſalvation.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The meaning then of this Scripture, that God juſtifieth the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, is not as if the perſon to be juſtified, muſt needs be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly in the midſt of his prophaneneſſe, delighting in it; but by ungodly is meant, a man that hath not a perfect legal righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, not an unſanctified man, as if he were a juſtified per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; this is a prophane Juſtification indeed, not agreeable to the nature of a Holy God; But the meaning is,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That God hath found out a way to juſtifie the ungodly by faith in Chriſt, which the Law knoweth not, nor the wiſdome of men and Angels could have contrived how God might do it, <hi>ſalvâ juſtitiâ,</hi> ſuppoſing his decree. And therefore when we ſay that God juſtifieth the ungodly, we underſtand it,</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>In ſenſudiviſo,</hi> not <hi>in ſenſu compoſito;</hi> that is, not that he is ſo when juſtified, as the Scripture ſaith, <hi>The lame man ſhall leap,</hi>

<pb n="137" facs="tcp:118254:81"/> ungodly are juſtified; for in order of nature, our Faith goes before Juſtification, though there be no priority of time between our ungodlineſſe and Juſtification; for immediately before our ſaith, we are ungodly, and upon the creation of faith, we are juſtified, and ſanctified at the ſame time, and our ungodlineſſe done away.</p>
               <p>And what if Faith be promiſed, and freely given, it is a fruit of the Covenant as made with Chriſt, but not as the Covenant was made with us; God covenants with Chriſt to ſave all that he died for, and that ſhall believe; ſo that upon believing they ſhall have the fruit of Chriſts death, and the fruit of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace; Chriſt undertakes for them to make them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; hence faith is wrought, and given, and then they are Chriſts Members, and ſo in Covenant, not before; for God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed ſalvation to none, but ſuch as believe; Hence Chriſt tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the world. <hi>This is the will of him that ſent me, that every one which ſeeth the Son, and believeth on him,</hi>

               <p>I ſhall not proſecute his opinion any further here, I will now lay down ſome animadverſions upon ſeveral paſſages in his Book, wherein his manifold errors, unſound opinions, and ſelf-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions ſhall be manifeſted, which he hath caſt himſelf upon in defence of this one error, and hath verified that old ſaying, <hi>Dato uno abſurdo, mille ſequuntur.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. They both ſtumble at the ſame ſtone, for the <hi>Arminians</hi> think it abſurd, that the ſame thing ſhould be <hi>donum promiſſum,</hi> and <hi>officium requiſitum,</hi> a gift promiſed on Gods part, and yet a duty required on our part.<note place="margin">Rem <hi>Apol. c</hi> 9. <hi>pag.</hi> 105.</note> Thus the <hi>Remonſtrants, Anne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionem quis ſeriò, &amp; ſapienter praeſcriberet alteri, ſub promiſſo praemii, &amp; poenae graviſſimae comminatione, qui eam in eo cui prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribit efficere vult, haec actio tota ludicra, &amp; vix ſcenà digna eſt, Nihil ineptius, nihil vanius quàm fidem merito Chriſti tribuere, ſi enim Christus meritus eſt fidem, tum fides conditio eſſe non poterit,</hi> c. 8. p. 95.</p>
               <p>They think it a ridiculous conceit, that any ſhould preſcribe that as a condition which he intendeth to work in them, or for them; and that faith, if it be merited by Chriſt, cannot be a condition.<note place="margin">Vide Mr. <hi>Eyre,</hi> pag. <hi>175.</hi>

The <hi>Arminians</hi> hold that no mans will is predeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by God, for fear they ſhould deſtroy the liberty of his will; and Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> ſaith in his Epiſtle Dedicatory to the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> Though God doth move effectually, and perſwades mens hearts, yet he doth not neceſſitate them to believe.

               <p>Secondly, He chargeth us that diſſent from him, in making Faith the condition of the Covenant, as if we did agree with <hi>Arminians, Socinians</hi> and <hi>Papiſts,</hi> when he is not ignorant that we manifeſtly differ from them, and own not faith as a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in any of their ſenſes; we make it not any meritorious condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as the <hi>Papiſts;</hi> nor any act performed by our own free will, as <hi>Arminians;</hi> nor the matter of our righteouſneſſe, as <hi>Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and <hi>Arminians,</hi> and <hi>Papiſts</hi> do, neither in whole, nor in part.

                     <hi>Mr.</hi> Eyre, <hi>p.</hi> 10.</note>Thirdly, Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> maketh a ſinner (if he be an Elect per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon) remaining under the reigning power of ſin, a ſubject of Juſtification: For he ſaith, <hi>God is well pleaſed with his Elect in Chriſt, whileſt they are unregenerate, though he be not well pleaſed with their unregeneracy, or any of their actions in their unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate eſtate.</hi>]</p>
               <p>But how can this be agreeable to the Holy Nature of God, to juſtifie a ſinner ſo remaining? For he that in this ſenſe juſtifieth the wicked, is an abomination to the Lord; and what God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth in us, he will not do himſelf. The Papiſts object againſt us that hold Juſtification by imputed, and not inherent righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, that it is contrary to the holineſſe, juſtice, and purity of Gods Nature to juſtifie us that are ungodly, without an inherent rightsouſneſſe. To which the Proteſtants anſwer, that God at the ſame time doth begin to ſanctifie whom he doth juſtifie, and he doth beſtow a righteouſneſſe of Sanctification, as well as of Juſtification; but Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi>'s opinion lieth juſtly liable to their exception, God cannot juſtifie any perſon, or be well pleaſed with him that is not a member of Chriſt, and to make an unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate man a member of Chriſts body, what a monſtrous deformity would this be, and wrong to Chriſt, to make a limb of the Devil, a member of Chriſt? Let a man be the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:118254:84" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſinner imaginable, practiſing and delighting in ſin; yet he is a juſtified perſon, and a member of Chriſt. If Elect, why doth Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> require the members of his Church to be Saints, not only by profeſſion, but by inward ſanctification, as that that ſhall make him a Church-member and yet holds an uregenerate perſon is a member of Chriſts body? will he require more holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in a Church-member, then in a Chriſt-member? And what an unreaſonable aſſertion is it for him to ſay, God is pleaſed with the Elect whileſt they are unregenerate, though he be not well pleaſed with their unregeneracy, or any of their actions in their unregenerate eſtate? Is it poſſible God can be well pleaſed with their perſons, and yet none of all their actions pleaſe him? is that tree a good tree that never did, nor can bring forth good fruit? As the Scripture maketh no mans actions accepted, when their perſons are not accepted, ſo neither doth it make their perſons acceptable, but their actions (ſome of them at leaſt) muſt be acceptable. And if their perſons be juſtified, all their ſins are pardoned, and many of their actions are for the matter good, and commanded; and when all the ſin in their beſt actions is done away, how can they diſpleaſe God, ſeeing nothing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſeth God but ſin?</p>
               <p>Fourthly, He ſaith, that the ſtate of the loved and hated,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Eyre,</hi> p. <hi>66.</hi> compared with pag. <hi>5.</hi>

<pb n="142" facs="tcp:118254:85"/> 
                  <hi>pag.</hi> 140. he ſaith, that ſin lay as a block in the way, that God could not <hi>ſalvâ justititiâ</hi> beſtow upon them thoſe good things intended towards them in his eternal Election.

And he citeth a place which he owneth out of Mr. <hi>Rutherford, pag.</hi> 140. God might will unto us that which he cannot actually beſtow upon us without wrong to his Juſtice, and this he underſtands of Gods ſaving and pardoning us; but if we were actually diſcharged, we were actually pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and that without the merit of Chriſts death, and ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to his juſtice.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, He interpreteth, <hi>pag.</hi> 60. what is meant by Gods ſight, when it is ſaid, <hi>We are juſtified in his ſight;</hi> this phraſe he ſaith, is variouſly uſed.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Sometimes it relates unto the thoughts and knowledge of God, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

If we take it for the knowledge of God, we were juſtified in his ſight when he willed and determined in himſelf not to impute to us our ſins, &amp;c. and this was from eternity. And with him the 63. <hi>pag.</hi> the eſſence and quiddity of Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation ſtands in this will of God not to puniſh, this is properly Juſtification in his judgement, and then God knew them to be righteous; yet he ſaith, in the article of Juſtification, knowledge is conſtantly diſtinguiſhed from ſight, throughout the whole Scripture, and God is never ſaid to blot ſins out of his knowledge, as much as if he ſhould ſay, If you take this phraſe as it is never
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:118254:85"/> to be taken, then we were juſtified from eternity. And the Scripture doth not acknowledge this eternal Juſtification; for when it ſpeaks of the Doctrine of Juſtification, it ſpeaketh of blotting out ſins out of his ſight, and this is to be referred to his legal Juſtice, (and this is the moſt proper and genuine uſe of it, ſaith he,) and ſo we were juſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>fied in the ſight of God when he exhibited, and God accepted the full ſatisfaction in his blood for all our ſins; and yet this Juſtification is not the moſt proper ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation of Juſtification, for that was from eternity, and yet we were then moſt properly juſtified in his ſight; how well this agrees, let the Reader judge.</p>

               <p>Tenthly, He giveth a worſe anſwer to that place, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.12. where it is ſaid, that the Elect before Faith or ſpiritual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation in their natural eſtate, were without Chriſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out God, and without hope in the world, that is, ſaith he, <hi>pag.</hi> 73. before faith, they had no knowledge or comfort, either of Gods gracious volitions towards them, or of Chriſts undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in their behalf; it is ſuch a chaffy, illiterate expoſition, that it more befits a Green-apron-Preacher, then ſuch a <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> it needs not a graine of ſalt; but all the ſalt in the world will not make a ſavoury interpretation of it, to keep it from the dunghill, What were theſe <hi>Epheſians</hi> when dead in ſins and treſpaſſes, dead in conceit only, and truly alive to God, and dead in their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions only? were they children of wrath in their appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions? why then, they were more afraid then hurt; what needed they then the work of Creation, the Almighty power of God that was put forth to raiſe Chriſt from the dead, to raiſe them from this eſtate; could no body cure this conceit with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other? that if they did but think all was well, that thought would be to them as the Reſurrection from the dead; What, were they without Chriſt in the world, becauſe they knew not Chriſt was there? Why then let ſome frenzy take them, and bereave them of their reaſon, as Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> was in this interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and they are un-Chriſted again; or let them fall aſleep, and they are again without Chriſt, without God, without hope in the world. And ſo they and their Chriſt will bid good-morrow, and good-night, ſo often as they riſe, or go to bed: But the true ſcope and ſenſe of the place is this, the Apoſtle ſetteth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to prove the freeneſſe of Gods grace in Chriſt to the <hi>Epheſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> which he doth, by calling upon them to remember what their former deplorable eſtate was in <hi>Ethniciſme,</hi> when they were Gentiles in the fleſh, by comparing it with their happy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate ſince their converſion to the faith; and therefore that won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful change, ſheweth that their ſalvation is wholly of grace;
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:118254:87" rendition="simple:additions"/> in their former condition they were then in the fleſh, that is, in their natural and ſinful eſtate, as they deſcended from their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents in a ſtate of ſin, living after the fleſh, in which eſtate they could not pleaſe God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They were without inward and outward circumciſion, they had none of the ſigne and ſeal of the Covenant of Grace, of that righteouſneſſe that is by faith, but were deſpiſed by the Jewes, who gloried in their circumciſion; but they had not ſo much as this outward circumciſion in the fleſh, much leſſe the circumciſion of the heart: Now uncircumciſion was a ſigne of a people that were wholly ſtrangers to God and the Covenant of Grace.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They were without Chriſt, without any knowledge of Chriſt; Chriſt was not ſo much as preached to them, and they had no faith in him, and ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

And from all this it followeth that they were unjuſtified in this eſtate, and it deſtroyeth the ſcope of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles argument, to take it as Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> taketh it, only for the want of knowledge of their happy eſtate, whereas the Apoſtles ſcope is to ſhew how miſerable they were when in this eſtate, how happy in the change, or deliverance from it; but here is no change ſignified by Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi>'s interpretation, but only their condition was the ſame, and as good then as now, only they did not know it; Is it poſſible a man of reaſon ſhould be ſo farre blinded, or hardened to ſhut his eyes againſt the clear light of the Scripture?

               <p>Twelfthly, He ſaith, that Juſtification is by Faith evidentially, and Faith is from Juſtification cauſally,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mr.</hi> Eyre, <hi>p.</hi> 79.</note> and he ſeeth no abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in it, <hi>p.</hi> 79. which is to place the Cart before the Horſe, and as prepoſterous as to wear his Shoes upon his head, and his Hat upon his feet. That Faith may in a ſenſe evidence Juſtification, I deny not, but that it is the effect of Juſtification, is as good ſenſe as that the daughter brought forth the mother; Juſtification may be an effect of Faith, and ſo the Scripture maketh it, but not a cauſe of Faith: For it is neither the efficient, nor material, nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall, nor final, therefore it is no cauſe; for all cauſes are redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible to theſe four Heads.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is not the efficient principall cauſe of Faith; I hope he will not rob Gods free grace, and the Holy Spirit of his Honour (as he doth Chriſt of his merit,) of being the ſole efficient cauſe of faith; Faith, it is the gift of God, and the effect of the Spirit,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:118254:88"/> which worketh faith by the hearing of the Word: it is a known rule, <hi>Poſitâ cauſâ proximâ ponitur effectus,</hi> and if the act of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification ſhould be the cauſe of Faith, then according to him being juſtified from eternity, we muſt be Believers from eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but how contrary this is to ſenſe, reaſon, and experience, I need not ſpeak; and no man did ever yet dreame, much leſſe ſpeak of Juſtification being the efficient cauſe of Faith.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is not the formall cauſe of Faith, for the formal cauſe doth <hi>ingredi compoſitum,</hi> it is part of the ſubſtance of the thing, or effect produced; the formall cauſe is alwayes intrinſecal to the effect, and concurreth to the ſubſtance and eſſence of it, but Juſtification is a thing wholly extrinſecal and adventitious to the nature of Faith; the formality of Faith lieth in an adherency to Chriſt, or a recumbency upon Chriſt for righteouſneſſe, not in the act of Juſtification.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Juſtification is not the materiall cauſe of Faith, for the ſame reaſon above named; the materiall cauſe is that which in u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the forme, maketh up a ſubſtantial compounded bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but Faith is no ſuch thing, it is not a ſubſtance, but a qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and hath no matter properly ſo called; and as for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter improperly ſo called, it is either <hi>materia in quâ,</hi> or <hi>circa quam,</hi> it is either the ſubject, or the object; but Juſtification is not the ſubject, or object of Faith; not the ſubject, for the ſubject of Faith is a Believer; nor is Juſtification the object of Faith, for in things that have matter improperly ſo called, the ſubject and the object are the ſame; the object of Juſtification then is a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, the perſon of a Believer, not his Faith.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And laſtly, Juſtification is not the finall cauſe of Faith, for I am not juſtified that I might believe, but rather I believe that I might be juſtified; and ſalvation is made the end of faith,<note place="margin">Gal. 2.16. 1 Pet. 1.9.</note> and not faith the end of my ſalvation; and thus it appeareth, that Faith is not from Juſtification cauſally.</p>
               <p>Thirteenthly, He ſaith, <hi>pag.</hi> 83. that he doth not preſſe every man to believe that he is juſtified,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mr</hi> Eyre <hi>p.</hi> 83.</note> but to believe there is a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency in Chriſt for his Juſtification, and to rely upon him, and him alone for this benefit; but how contrary this is to his own principles, let the Reader judge: for he conſtantly affirmeth,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:118254:89"/> that the Elect are juſtified from eternity, and from the death of Chriſt antecedently to Faith, and faith doth not inſtrumentally apply Chriſts righteouſneſs unto Juſtification, but Faith doth only evidence Juſtification to the conſcience: Surely, when you preſſe men to believe, you preſſe them to believe they are alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy juſtified, and not to rely on him for this benefit; for if they be juſtified already, what need have they to rely upon him by faith for it? they may according to you rely upon him for the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videncing of this to their conſciences, but not for the benefit which they had in Chriſt before they were borne. And what di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution is it of the grace of Chriſt, if they were juſtified from the time of Chriſts death, to tell them there is a ſufficiency in the death of Chriſt for Juſtification? when according to you there is an efficiency in the death of Chriſt; foraſmuch as they were not virtually only, but <hi>actually</hi> and <hi>formally,</hi> as you affirme, <hi>p.</hi> 63. ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified at his death: Nor will it help you to ſay, you ſpeak there of the <hi>non-elect,</hi> for we are bound to preſſe all men to believe, as you there acknowledge; and it is not known who are Elect, neither to the Miniſter nor to the people; therefore in preſſing the Elect to believe a ſufficiency, you extenuate the merit of Chriſts death, if they were actually juſtified, as you af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme: And there is the ſame ground of Faith to all, the abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Chriſt to ſave, and Gods indefinite offer of ſalvation to whomſoever the Goſpel is preached.</p>
               <p>Fourteenthly, He affirmeth Faith, if it evidences our Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is a ſigne, is a dark and unſatisfying evidence, as other works of Sanctification are,<note place="margin">1 John 3.14.</note> where he contradicteth the Apoſtle, who ſaith, <hi>By this we know that we are paſſed from death to life, becauſe we love the Brethren;</hi> not we hope, not we conjecture, but we know, it is a ſure and ſtedfaſt ſigne. <hi>Little children, let no man deceive you,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 John 3.7.</note> ſaith <hi>John, he that doth righteouſneſſe, is righteous;</hi> is thereby, <hi>viz.</hi> by his doing righteouſneſſe declared to be a righteous perſon;<note place="margin">Rom. 8.1.</note> and in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. he ſaith, <hi>There is no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jeſus;</hi> and he givesh this as a ſigne,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.13.</note> 
                  <hi>Who are in Chriſt, who walk not after the fleſh, but after the Spirit;</hi> doth the Holy Ghoſt, by <hi>Paul,</hi> give us a dark unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying evidence of our being in Chriſt. What is more frequent
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:118254:89"/> then this; he that is in Chriſt, is a new Creature, they that mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the deeds of the body ſhall live:<note place="margin">Gal 5.24.</note> 
                  <hi>They that are Chriſts have crucified the fleſh, with the affections and luſts thereof?</hi> are all theſe dark and unſatisfying evidences? then the Apoſtle did not well to propound them as ſatisfying evidences of the perſons that are in Chriſt, and ſhall be ſaved; but we had rather ſuſpect Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi>'s opinion, then queſtion the Apoſtles judgement or unfaithfulneſs to propound dark, and unſatisfying evidences of Juſtification.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He ſaith, that nothing that followes Faith, is ſo apt to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence or prove Juſtification as Faith, becauſe it is the firſt of all inherent graces; but I take this for an errour, and that works are every way as declarative of Juſtification, if not more, is an apparent truth: For firſt, if we ſpeak of evidencing Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to others, it is more; for ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Thou haſt faith, ſhew me thy faith without thy works, and I will ſhew thee my faith by my works,</hi> James 2.18.

                  <hi>and yet liveth in the practice of any known ſin, I ſhall be bold to tell him he is a liar, and the truth is not in him;</hi> and works of Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are no leſſe declarative of Juſtification in evidencing it to the conſcience, then Faith: For how ſhall I know my ſaith is a true faith, an unfeigned faith, and peculiar to the Elect; but by the effect of a true Faith, the works of Sanctification, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if the truth of my faith be evidenced by my works, then the truth of my juſtification is no leſſe evidenced to my conſcience by works then by faith; nor is his reaſon of any worth, becauſe it is the firſt of all inherent graces; this may prove it to have an excellency in that reſpect above other graces, but that it hath for this reaſon an eminency above other graces in evidencing Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, is a lame conſequence, of which Maſter <hi>Eyre</hi>'s Book is too full.</p>
               <p>Fifteenthly, He affirmerh that we ſhould not be juſtified freely by grace, if any condition were required of us in order to our Juſtification; I take this alſo for a manifeſt errour, if it be underſtood aright, of an Evangelical condition ordained and wrought by God for the applying of Chriſts righteouſneſſe to Juſtification. Indeed, if you take a condition in a ſtrict ſenſe;
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:118254:90"/> for a condition performed by us without the help of grace, meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and obliging God to give us the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt; in ſuch a ſenſe it is true, it is inconſiſtent with grace: but ſuch an Evangelical condition wrought by the grace of Chriſt, without which we are not juſtified, ſalvation is no leſſe of grace, though it be by faith, as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh: <hi>Ye are ſaved by grace through faith, and that not of your ſelves, it is the gift of God;</hi> where the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of the grace of faith,<note place="margin">Eph. 2.8.</note> and ſaith, we are ſaved by it; and yet he ſaith, <hi>We are ſaved by grace, becauſe it is Gods gift.</hi>
               </p>

If all the bleſſings of the Covenant be alike abſolutely, and freely given, and alike merited by Chriſt, and yet God may for order and methods ſake, deferre ſome bleſſings of the Covenant without wrong to Chriſts merits and ſatisfaction, why is it any wrong to Chriſts death, if Juſtification merited by Chriſt, be ſuſpended untill it be fitly applied by faith, (that God may not juſtifie a perſon under the reigne and power of ſinne, which is not agreeable to his Holineſſe and Juſtice?)</p>

What will this man make the Kingdome of Heaven to be, that admits of ſuch Sodomites, and Whoremongers, to be the actuall heires of it? If they had a right to the Kingdome of Heaven, they were a bleſſed people; Oh bleſſed Sodomites! Oh bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Whoremongers! if this Doctrine be true; here was all the unhappineſſe of theſe Sodomitical Saints, they knew not their happineſſe before, they had as much right to ſalvation as before, only they had more knowledge of it after believing; but if they had as much right, why doth the Apoſtle ſay as ſuch, <hi>they could not inherit the Kingdome of God? Be not deceived, no ſuch ſhall inherit the Kingdome of God;</hi> why then, what a wrong is this to them, when they have a right to the Kingdome of God? Do any perſons more deſerve the ſame ſtile of the <hi>Gnoſticks</hi> of old, to be called the dirty Sect, then ſuch panders for the fleſh as theſe?

And are their beſt actions, ſuch as are their praying, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for the matter good, and duties commanded? and are all the ſins pardoned, which make them only evil in Gods ſight, and yet are they abominable and loathſome in his ſight? who will believe you? can the want of faith (which is by you pardoned) hinder the acceptance of their works, and not the acceptance of their perſons? Nay, what do you affirme of the actions of the Regenerate more, then may be ſaid of the actions of the Elect unregenerate? if they be juſtified perſons, as you ſay they are; for the beſt works of <hi>unregenerat, juſtified Infidels,</hi> as you will have it, are (as you ſay) of the regenerate, pleaſing to God, not only comparatively, becauſe better then the works of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates, or then the ſins of unregenerate perſons, but abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, 1. Abſtractly, as you affirme of the others, and in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, for they are ſuch things as are lawful, and commanded; and if they faile in the manner of doing it, in faith, hope, and love, this is but a faile in the manner; and <hi>Gradus non variat ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciem,</hi> and the Regenerate Elect, faile in the meaſure of faith, hope, and love; neither in them doth their faith, hope, or love, merit the acceptance of their duties And, 2.

               <p>Let not the ignorant Reader miſtake me here, I affirme not that any duties of an unregenerate perſon are acceptable to God, or that the want of faith, hope, and love, maketh but a failing only in the manner and circumſtances of the dutie; but I have only preſented the Reader with a glaſſe, to let him ſee that Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> for all the ſeeming difference he maketh between the actions of the Elect Regenerate, and unregenerate; yet indeed maketh none, and according to him it cannot be found.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> Proving that we are not juſtified from Eternity.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>ERE I ſhall premiſe theſe few things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That as we hold Juſtification to be a tranſient act, done in time, ſo there is no tranſient act, but it preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth neceſſarily an immanent act in God.</p>
               <p>And therefore ſecondly, I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge there was an eternal, and an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable act of Gods will, decreeing to juſtifie his Elect in time, through faith in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, As for that conditionate decree, which <hi>Arminians</hi> make in God, making the condition antecedent to the act of Gods will, I no way acknowledge, and judge it abſolutely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with Gods Nature and Eſſence; but ſuch a conditional decree, as is ſo called ſubſequently, not in reſpect of God wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, but in reſpect of the thing willed, <hi>ſive objecti voliti,</hi> is not repugnant to him eſpecially in ſuch contingent effects as come to paſſe by vertue of his decree ordaining them; Thus God willeth ſalvation to the Elect, which ſalvation they ſhall be brought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by faith in Chriſt; not that faith is the cauſe of the act of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, or God willing their ſalvation; yet it may be the cauſe of the thing willed, a ſubſequent condition wrought by God for the execution of his decree: And therefore when the Orthodox acknowledge Election to be abſolute, they underſtand it not excluſively to the means which God hath ordained for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:118254:93"/> of ſalvation; for God in the ſame eternall act did ordain the end and the meanes; hence <hi>Paul</hi> telleth the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> that <hi>God hath from the beginning choſen them to ſalvation, through ſanctification of the Spirit,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Theſſ. 2.13. 1 Pet. 1.2.</note> 
                  <hi>and belief of the truth;</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>The ſtrangers he wrote unto, according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through ſanctification of the Spirit unto obedience, and ſprinkling of the blood of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And as I acknowledge this to be an eternall decree, <hi>(Becauſe he choſe us in him before the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the world, that we ſhould be holy,)</hi> ſo I willingly grant it to be immutable; for he that changeth his purpoſe, doth it for want of wiſdome in deliberating, or for want of power to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute it, neither of which can be aſcribed to God without blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy. And hence the Scripture ſaith, <hi>The foundation of God ſtandeth ſure, having this ſeal, The Lord knoweth who are his.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, I grant that Chriſt was elected, and conſtituted to be a Head, and all the Elect were predeſtinated to be his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and in this ſenſe we were choſen in him, (not exiſting) but only we were pre-ordained unto ſalvation by him. And that this act was one in God, in reſpect of whole Chriſt myſtical: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I deny, that the Elect were by this act of God myſtically united unto Chriſt, which is done upon believing; yet I grant a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain relative reſpect, and mutual relation between them. In which ſenſe the Elect are called his people, before he ſaved them from their ſins, and while they were not yet converted, and his ſheep for which he laid down his life, although not yet brought home to him; yet was not Chriſt the meritorious cauſe of their Election (much leſſe their foreſeen faith, or good works,) although he be the cauſe of the effects of their Election; as therefore this ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto which we are predeſtinated, is the act of God, ſo Chriſt is the effect of Gods love of Election, and the means of ſalvation, and our ſalvation is the end, in reſpect of us; but as this ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is our good, ſo Chriſt is the cauſe of it.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Though Chriſt were thus predeſtinated to be a Head, and the Elect his Members, yet was not he a Head actually from eternity, nor the Elect actual members, becauſe he had not a myſtical body from eternity; and although God decreed from eternity to juſtifie the Elect through faith in Chriſt, yet were not
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:118254:93"/> they actually juſtified: For<note n="*" place="margin">Praedeſtinatio enim an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> Predeſtination maketh no inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall difference between the Elect and Reprobate, untill actuall grace be given for applying the things intended in Election; nor doth Predeſtination neceſſarily preſuppoſe the exiſtence of its terme<note n="*" place="margin">Praedeſtinatio enim nec termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num nec objectum ſuum neceſſariò praeſupponit ut exiſtens, ſed ponit ut exiſtat ità ut vi praedeſtinatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis ordinetur ut ſit. <hi>Ameſii</hi> Medul. c. <hi>25.</hi> ſ. <hi>8.</hi>
                  </note>, nor object, but the futurity of both. Having premiſed theſe things, (which I have the rather more fully done, becauſe he repreſenteth me and ſuch as differ from him, as <hi>Arminians</hi> and <hi>Papiſts,</hi>) I ſhall now prove that we were not juſtified from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Gods decree to juſtifie, is <hi>terminus diminuens,</hi> is a terme of diminution, and therefore is not actuall Juſtification; 'tis <hi>amor ordinativus,</hi> but it is not <hi>amor collativus;</hi> it is a love ordaining, and preparing good things for us, but not an actuall beſtowing them; Juſtification is an actual beſtowing of ſome ſpecial mercy, a diſcharge from the guilt of ſin and death, a paſſing us from an eſtate of death into an eſtate of life; this may be intended, but is not actually performed by Predeſtination, for it's a known rule, <hi>Praedeſtinatio nihil ponit in Praedeſtinato:</hi> but I will not ſtrangle the queſtion ſo by the prejudice of a word or two, therefore I argue,</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Scripture no where ſpeaketh of an eternal Juſtification; Therefore we were not juſtified from eternity. The Antecedent is acknowledged and made uſe of by Mr. <hi>Eyre,</hi> and a negative argument in matters of great concernment, is of neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, 'tis not written, therefore there is no ſuch thing: now let Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> produce one Scripture, wherein the decree of God to juſtifie is called Juſtification, and I yield the cauſe,</p>
               <p n="3">3. That that is an act of God done in time, was not done from eternity; But Juſtification is an act of God done in time; Therefore it was not from eternity. The <hi>Major</hi> needs no proof, the <hi>Minor</hi> is no leſſe evident, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.8.<note place="margin">Gal. 3.8.</note> 
                  <hi>The Scripture foreſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that God would juſtifie the Heathen through fainh, preached the Goſpel before unto Abraham,</hi> ſaying, <hi>in theſe ſhall all the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the earth be bleſſed,</hi> where the Apoſtle maketh it a work to
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:118254:94"/> be done in time, that God would juſtifie the Gentiles through faith, not that he had juſtified them; whereas if he had meant Juſtification was eternal, it had been ſenſeleſſe for him to ſay, that God would do that which was done already; nor is this meant of a declarative juſtification <hi>in foro conſcientiae,</hi> for it is ſuch a juſtification as <hi>Abraham</hi> had, but <hi>Abraham</hi> was not only juſtified in his conſcience, but before God; So, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.18, 19. God hath reconciled us to himſelf by <hi>Jeſus Christ.</hi> And God was in Chriſt reconciling the world unto himſelf, not imputing their tranſgreſſions to them; But Chriſt did reconcile us in time, and not from eternity; Therefore God did not juſtifie from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Chriſt reconciles us to God, not only as God, but as God-man, by h s death, but Chriſt was not God-man, and died not from eternity; Therefore, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That action of God which maketh a real change in the creature, is a tranſient action done in time, becauſe it paſſeth from God to the creature, and ſome way worketh a change; But Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification is ſuch an action of God that maketh a preſent change; Therfore it is a tranſient, not an immanent act. The <hi>Major</hi> is clear, for what action ſoever is terminated <hi>in patiente,</hi> or upon the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is certainly tranſient, becauſe it doth not remaine in God; and if tranſient, it muſt be temporary, for no creature did exiſt from eternity. The <hi>Minor</hi> will invincibly remain a truth, for it is moſt certaine, that by Juſtification the ſtate of a ſinner is changed; he that was in the ſtate of condemnation, is now in the ſtate of ſalvation; Juſtification is oppoſed to condemnation, <hi>He that is under condemnation, is not juſtified, and he that is juſtified, is freed from condemnation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now let us ſee what he anſwereth to this, <hi>pag.</hi> 65. where he anſwereth this Objection, that Juſtification imports a change, which cannot be attributed to the ſimple decrees of God.</p>
               <p>He anſwereth, <hi>That if Justification be taken for the thing wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, the delivery of a ſinner from the curſe of the Law, then there is a great change made, &amp;c. but if we take it for the will of God not to puniſh, then we ſay Juſtification doth not ſuppoſe a change, as if God had a will to puniſh his Elect, but afterwards he altered his will to a will not to puniſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Where let the Reader obſerve the vanity of his diſtinction, in
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:118254:94"/> ſeparating the thing willed from the act of Gods will; for the whole nature of Juſtification doth not conſiſt in the thing willed, to wit, a delivery of the ſinner from the curſe of the Law, but in ſome act of God as a Judge declaring his will to deliver. Take a man condemned to die by a Judge, this priſoner may by power be reſcued from the ſentence for the preſent, but is he therefore juſtified, and acquitted in Law by the Judge? Juſtification is an act of God delivering the ſinner, or acquitting him from the crime, or accuſation laid to his charge, and ſo from condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and where this is, there is neceſſarily a change.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Obſerve his equivocation, and fallacy in the ſecond mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his diſtinction; if we take it for the will of God not to puniſh, and then Juſtification doth not import a change, as if God had a will to puniſh his Elect, but afterwards he altered his will not to puniſh them; we are ſpeaking of a change made by Juſtification upon the ſinner, he ſaith, there is none made in Gods will, <hi>quid hoc ad rhombum?</hi> and who ſaid that God did firſt will, and then ceaſe to will, and then take up a new volition? truly, <hi>Arminians</hi> feign ſuch a mutability in God, but the Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox abhorre it: Nor doth Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> rightly underſtand, at leaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe repreſent the Orthodox Doctrine; we ſay, and that truly, that God by one act of his will, willed that he that is a ſinner, and remaineth ſo in unbelief, ſhould be liable to condemnation, and that upon believing he ſhall be freed from condemnation, that before faith he ſhould be in a ſtate of ſin, and conſequently of damnation, and upon faith that he ſhould be juſtified, and delivered from it. Here is no change in Gods will, but in the object; a great change in man, but not in God; God may <hi>velle mutationem,</hi> when he doth not, as <hi>Aquinas</hi> ſaith, <hi>mutare volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem:</hi> God may will a change in the creature, when he doth not change his own will; as a Father may will at his death, and accordingly bequeatheth an eſtate to a prodigal childe, and in caſe he will become a new man, he ſhall poſſeſſe and enjoy it; but if he will not, he ſhall go without it; here he wills a change, but doth not change his will: So it is in the preſent caſe.</p>
               <p>I will here alſo take notice what he addeth, <hi>The change of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons state ariſeth from the Law, and the conſideration of man there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, by whoſe ſentence the tranſgreſſor is unjuſt: but conſidered at
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:118254:95"/> the tribunal of Grace, he is righteous, which is not properly a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent eſtate before God, but a different conſideration of the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: God may be ſaid to look upon him as ſinful, and righteous; as ſinful in reference to his ſtate by nature, as righteous to his eſtate by Grace.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer, The change of a mans ſtate ariſeth not from the Law, (for that condemneth him) but from an act of God acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him from the Law; if God did not acquit him, the Law would not; 'Tis true, the Law pronounceth him guilty, becauſe a tranſgreſſor, and ſo doth God, whoſe Law it is; for it was the will of God, ſo long as he remaineth a tranſgreſſor, without a righteouſneſſe to deliver him, that he ſtould be in a damnable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, and upon ſuch a righteouſneſſe as God hath provided in Chriſt, if he believe, and be cloathed with this righteouſneſſe, he ſhall be ſaved: Now 'tis true, this mans ſtate is really changed, but God is not changed; for he willed according to his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Law, his condemnation, he willeth upon believing his ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and this with one eternal unchangeable act of his will, and whom he hath elected, he giveth faith, hence they are juſtified; here is a new effect of Gods love, but not any new immanent act. Nor is there any truth in that, that God looks upon a man at the ſame time as ſinful, and righteous; if you mean by it an eſtate of ſin, and a righteous or juſtified eſtate, for this would aſcribe to God a fallible judgement, to judge them otherwiſe then they are; but if your meaning be he may ſee at the ſame time what they were by nature, and what they are by grace, 'tis not denied; but to look upon them as being in their naturall eſtate, and in a ſtate of grace at the ſame time, implies an errour in his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is blaſphemy to imagine, and is a contradiction <hi>in adjecto.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Chriſts death is the meritorious cauſe of our Juſtification; But Chriſts death was not the meritorious cauſe of Gods eternall purpoſe; Therefore that immanent act, or eternal purpoſe of God to juſtifie us, is not our juſtification.

Beſides, our deliverance from the Law, is an effect of Juſtification, not Juſtification it ſelf, which is an act of God for Chriſts ſake forgiving us, upon which followeth our delivery from the Law.</p>
               <p n="6">6. If we were actually and formally juſtified from eternity, then Chriſt died in vain, or his death was not to purchaſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſe, but to apply forgiveneſſe, or to manifeſt Gods love, not to ſatisfie Gods juſtice: But Chriſts death was not in vaine; he died, not only to apply, but to purchaſe forgiveneſſe; not to manifeſt Gods love only, but to ſatisfie Gods juſtice; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the firſt conſequence is evident, becauſe his death was in vain, as to the act of Juſtification: for as in the former Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Chriſts death was not the cauſe of that act, and Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> acknowledgeth no other, and yet he will have Chriſts death to be the cauſe of the effect of that will; how can it cauſe the effect, and be no cauſe of any act of Gods will? for we acknowledge it the cauſe of the tranſient act of Gods will, which is properly our juſtification, which act he will not acknowledge. The ſecond inference is evident; for if we were juſtified from eternity, then we were forgiven from eternity, and then either Chriſt doth but apply it at the moſt, for he did not purchaſe it, or only he doth but manifeſt Gods love to the world; but the Scripture is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, That he hath purchaſed forgiveneſs, <hi>In whom we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption through his blood, the forgiveneſſe of our ſins;</hi> and he died to ſatisfie Gods juſtice; hence, <hi>he is a propitiation for our ſins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. This overthroweth the merit of Chriſts death, becauſe, if we were juſtified from eternity, then Juſtification is a due debt to the Elect, and then what place is left for Chriſts merit?
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:118254:96" rendition="simple:additions"/> for it muſt be <hi>bonum indebitum:</hi> that that is properly merited, was not due before; but if we were juſtified, then it was due, and ſo no roome is left for Chriſts merits.</p>
               <p n="8">8. That which will not ſecure the ſinner from wrath, is not Juſtification: But this decree will not ſecure the ſinner from wrath. The <hi>Major</hi> is evident, for how can he be juſtified that is not ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured from condemnation? The <hi>Minor</hi> I prove, becauſe notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding Gods decree Chriſt muſt die, there was a neceſſity of Chriſts death, (ſuppoſing Gods decree not to pardon ſin without a ſatisfaction;) I grant that Gods decree doth eventualy ſecure the Elect, but not actually; it is true, becauſe a man is Elect, he ſhall not as to the event be damned, but God will give faith to apply Chriſts righteouſneſſe; but this is not an actual acquittance, or diſcharge from ſin, when the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect?</hi> that is, to ſuch as are declared, or evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced to be Elect by believing, or effectual vocation. And that the Apoſtle muſt mean ſo, is evident; the Apoſtle is comforting in that Chapter Believers that are in Chriſt againſt condemnation: Now this he proveth, becauſe they are Elect, <hi>The Elect ſhall not be condemned, but you are Elect;</hi> Now how ſhall this be known? by faith and our effectual vocation: Hence in the 30. <hi>ver.</hi> he ſpeaketh of effectual vocation, as that that precedeth and is a ſign of Election; and hence we are commanded <hi>to make our Calling and Election ſure.</hi> Why is Calling put before Election? becauſe our Election is unknown to any, till it be evidenced by their effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Calling. Now ſurely the Apoſtle did not barely propound Election as a ſigne of Juſtification, without ſome means to know it: for, how can a thing ſo ſecret be a comfort till it be manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? and how ſhall it be manifeſted, but by Faith and Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? therefore ſurely they being the ſubjects of his diſcourſe, muſt be underſtood by the Elect; Now if you take the Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as an univerſal Negative, or univerſal Affirmative, No Elect Believer can be juſtly charged with ſin, or All Elect Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers are freed from the charge of ſin, both are true; but to take it for the Elect antecedently to Faith, the Propoſition is not true: for the Word may, and doth charge him with ſin, for it threateneth damnation to him, but it threateneth damnation for nothing but ſin, and God doth look upon him as a ſinner, and
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:118254:96"/> he ought to charge himſelf with ſin; therefore though all Elect Believers ſhall be freed from ſin, yet all the Elect are not formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcharged from ſin. As for your weak and feeble endeavour to caſt an <hi>Odium</hi> of ſimplicity upon ſo learned a man as Maſter <hi>Burges,</hi> who is well known to be an <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> to Mr. <hi>Eyre,</hi> that he ſhould ſpeak as weakly as if he ſaid, <hi>Omne animal</hi> is <hi>rationale,</hi> and to excuſe it ſhould ſay, that by <hi>omne animal</hi> he meant <hi>omnis homo,</hi> and to prove the expreſſion legitimate, ſhould alledge that <hi>homo</hi> is often called <hi>animal,</hi> which is true; but very imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent to prove, that <hi>omne animal</hi> may be put for <hi>omnis homo;</hi> but it may be very juſtly retorted upon Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> thus, His opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is, as if one ſhould ſay, All the unregenerate whoremongers in the act of their uncleanneſſe, if they be Elect perſons, are Saints; and to excuſe it, ſhould ſay by Saints, he meaneth juſtified per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; and to prove the expreſſion legitimate, ſhould ſay, the juſtified perſons are often called Saints, which is true; but very impertinent to prove that unregenerate Elect perſons wallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in uncleanneſſe are Saints.</p>
               <p n="9">9. That which maketh an Elect perſon never to be a ſinner, not to be borne a ſinner, under the guilt of ſin, ſo as to be a childe of wrath, is contrary to the Scriptures; But to aſſert with Mr. <hi>Eyre,</hi> that the Elect are juſtified from eternity, is to make them never to be ſinners, under the guilt of ſin, and children of wrath; Therefore it is inconſiſtent with the Scriptures to affirme eternal Juſtification. For the <hi>Major,</hi> it is evident, that the Scriptures call even the Elect ſinners, <hi>children of wrath, Epheſ.</hi> 2.1, 2, 3. thus the Apoſtle putteth himſelf into the number, and ſaith he, <hi>And they were children of diſobedience, under the power of Satan,</hi>

                  <hi>dead in ſins and treſpaſſes, workers of iniquity, and children of wrath as well as others.</hi> And they could not be at the ſame time children of wrath, and in the favour of God, and ſo he argueth in his 138. <hi>page,</hi> in his ſecond Argument, to prove we are immediately and actually reconciled from the time of Chriſts death, he ſaith, They for whom Chriſt died, could not be the children of Chriſt at the ſame time, and children of wrath, and yet will not acknowledge the truth of it, when we urge it againſt his eternal Juſtification; but let us ſee what he anſwereth to it in his 111. <hi>pag.</hi> in anſwer to this Scripture, he ſaith, it ſpeaks moſt fully to the cauſe, but he anſwereth two things.</p>
               <pb n="166" facs="tcp:118254:97"/>
               <p>Firſt, That the Text doth not ſay, God did condemne them, or that they were under condemnation before converſion.</p>
               <p n="2">2<hi rend="sup">dly</hi>. That the Emphaſis of the Text lieth in this clauſe, <hi>[That they were by nature] children of wrath,</hi> that is, in reference to their ſtate in the firſt <hi>Adam;</hi> but this hinders not, but that by grace they might be children of love.</p>
               <p n="1">[1. He ſaith, the Text doth not ſay that God did condemne them,] I anſwer, it ſaith that that is equivalent to it; for it ſaith, <hi>they were children of wrath;</hi> by the wrath there, all Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors agree is meant the wrath of God; and when they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>children of wrath,</hi> it is an Hebraiſme, ſignifying that they were borne ſuch, and ſurely ſubject to it, and obnoxious to divine wrath, and guilty of eternall death; and to call a man a childe of wrath, is to aggravate the miſery; as a ſon of perdition, is a hopeleſſe, wretched, loſt perſon; the ſon of diſobedience, a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry graceleſſe, diſobedient wretch; ſo a childe of wrath, he is one to whom wrath is eminently due, as an inheritance is to a child, and this is utterly inconſiſtent with the grace of Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for no juſtified perſon can be truly ſaid after his Juſtification to be a childe of wrath, liable to damnation, and guilty of it. For the clear underſtanding of this, we muſt know what is meant by the wrath of God, to which the Elect are ſubject.</p>
               <p>Firſt, By the wrath of God we muſt not underſtand any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent affection in God oppoſite to his eternal love of benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, or good will that he did beare to his Elect; For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is not properly any affection in God that is a paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to which God is not ſubject.</p>
               <p n="2">2. God cannot hate, or be angry with his Elect, ſo as to ceaſe bearing the ſame good will towards them that he did from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity.<note place="margin">James 1.17.</note> This were no leſſe then <hi>Vorſtian</hi> blaſphemy, for with him there is not the leaſt ſhadow of turning. This wrath then muſt be ſomething that leaves them liable to the ſame condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the Reprobates, though with this difference, that God bearing them this love of good-will, will not leave them in it, as he will the others; for which cauſe he is ſaid to love the Elect, and to hate the Reprobate.</p>
               <p>I anſwer therefore, the wrath of God may be taken for that juſt and holy immutable will of God to puniſh, and revenge the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:118254:97"/> ſinnes committed againſt him; hence the Lord having created man, from whom as his creature he might juſtly expect obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, he therefore gives him a Law, and commandeth his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, threatening his ſinne, or diſobedience with eternall death or damnation; this Law is given to all, both Elect and Reprobates, and all alike are bound to yield obedience, and alike threatened in caſe of diſobedience; now <hi>Adam</hi> in whom we all were, as in our common Parent, being intruſted as a common perſon with ſufficient grace to yield obedience for himſelf and us, God maketh a Covenant with him, and in him with us, to give us eternall life in caſe of obedience, and to puniſh him and us with eternal death in caſe of diſobedience; he ſinned, and we all in him, and thus become liable to condemnation threatened; this is the wrath here meant, when we are ſaid to be children of wrath, that is, liable to condemnation, and eternall death: Now the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect are involved in this eſtate as well as others; but now God from all eternity, bearing good-will to his Elect, and purpoſing to ſave them, and to leave the others under the condemnation into which they are fallen, purpoſed to give Chriſt to take the puniſhment due to their ſins, and the wrath due to their perſons, willing that Chriſt ſhould ſuffer what was due to them, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing to give them deliverance from this condemnation through Chriſt upon believing. Now Chriſt being made a ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> ordained to be head of the Elect, the Elect muſt be in him before they can be partakers of the benefit of his death, to give them an actual deliverance from the wrath threatened; for we were not ſinners in <hi>Adam</hi> only by imputation, as an act of Sovereignty, but were in him in a natural way, from whom we are deſcended; this natural union being the ground of Gods imputation of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams</hi> ſin to his poſterity, together with Gods ordaining him a publick perſon; now all ſinned in him virtually, and were virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally guilty of eternal death, and actually become ſubject to it at their birth; and hence the Elect being borne of <hi>Adam,</hi> they become as yet members of him, and ſo are ſubject unto death as well as others, and ſo remain till God cut them off from the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> and implant them into the ſecond, this is done by faith; for faith is not our righteouſneſſe, by and for which we are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, but anſwereth to that which is the ground of our being par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers with <hi>Adams</hi> ſin; for we being one with <hi>Adam,</hi> in reſpect
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:118254:98"/> of original and nature, were in him, and one with him, and were ſo involved in his guilt; even ſo by faith we are implanted into Chriſt by a work of the Spirit, cutting us off by the Law from the old ſtock upon which we grew, and by faith which he worketh in the Goſpel, he implanteth us into Chriſt, hereby we are only united, and now being one, hence his death and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in the merit of it is imputed to us, and hereby are we actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acquitted and juſtified, and delivered from that wrath we were ſubject to by nature. Hence then it is evident that we are children of wrath, liable to condemnation at our birth, and then were not juſtified from eternity; for if we were juſtified from eternity, then we never were borne ſinners, under the guilt of ſin, liable to condemnation, for Juſtification is a removal of this guilt; therefore the Scripture ſaying <hi>we are children of wrath by nature,</hi> denieth this eternall Juſtification, and ſo the <hi>Minor</hi> is alſo made evident.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I anſwer therefore to the ſecond part of Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi>'s an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, where he ſaith, that the Emphaſis of this Scripture lieth in theſe words, <hi>[by nature]</hi> where he ſaith, that in reference to their eſtate in <hi>Adam,</hi> they were children of wrath, they could expect nothing but fiery indignation, yet this hindereth not but that by grace they might be children of his love, &amp;c. Where ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, That the Apoſtle doth not ſpeak of their naturall eſtate, what it is as they are deſcended from <hi>Adam,</hi> but he ſpeaketh of it what it was, as that which they were actually delivered from, and are now not in the ſame ſtate they were. And that was a ſtate inconſiſtent with the ſtate of Juſtification, for it implies a contradiction, that they ſhould be in both at the ſame time, and that in reference to God; 'tis true, they may be conſidered joyntly in the minde of a man, but no man can actually be in both theſe eſtates; ſure, they are two different eſtates, the Apoſtle is ſpeaking of one in <hi>Adam,</hi> another in <hi>Chriſt</hi> by faith, and at their birth they were in the firſt, in which they could expect no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but wrath, and God in that eſtate could not pardon them, keeping to his own order of ſalvation, therefore then they were not juſtified; therefore when he ſaith, that this firſt eſtate hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not, but that by grace they might be the children of love, if he mean only that they might be the object of Gods love of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:118254:98" rendition="simple:additions"/> and as an effect of it be brought out of that eſtate, it is not denied; but if he mean that they were not then guilty of, and ſubject to the wrath of God, and ſo were objects of Gods love of complacency, and juſtified, and that they had as much freedome and deliverance from hell, and actuall right to ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it is denied, and he apparently contradicteth the Holy Ghoſt, who ſaith, <hi>they are children of wrath,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John 3.36.</note> and that while they remain in unbelief, <hi>the wrath of God abideth on them;</hi> there it was, and will remain till removed by faith; and it is not we that ſuborne the Spirit to ſerve our turne, but he is found to bear falſe witneſſe againſt the Holy Ghoſt.</p>

For the Law is the Law of God, and what power it hath to threaten and condemne, it hath it from God, and therefore when that condemneth, God condemneth; if the perſon be not already delivered from the damning power of it by Chriſt through believing, ſo that it is not a meer ſcare-crow, or bug-beare to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright the conſciences of the Elect, when it cannot reach their perſons; for it holdeth their perſons under condemnation, till by faith laying hold upon Chriſt, they are delivered from the ſentence of the Law; for <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh of himſelf, and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving <hi>Romans,</hi>

The Apoſtle in that Chapter ſpeaketh not of being under the Law as a rule of life only, but he ſpeaketh of being under the reign and dominion of it unto death, ſo as that a man while under it is dead to Chriſt, and that he and the Elect <hi>Romans</hi> were thus while they were in the fleſh.</p>

<pb n="172" facs="tcp:118254:100"/> then they never were under this damning power, nor were guilty before God; for if they were freed from eternity, when were they guilty? if there were any moment of time wherein they were not free, then they were not juſtified from eternity.</p>

Now this aſſumption is evident; for though Gods will be the cauſe of reprobation, yet ſin is the cauſe of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates condemnation; but God cannot in juſtice condemne them for that which they never were yet guilty of; it's true, God loved <hi>Jacob,</hi> and hated <hi>Eſau</hi> before they had done good or evil, they had not then according to Scripture done evil, and then God could not condemne them, though he might paſſe them by, and not Elect them, which is negatively or privatively called hatred.</p>

<pb n="173" facs="tcp:118254:100"/> his reaſon is of no force; for to be the ſubject of a moral change, doth as neceſſarily require the exiſtence of the perſon, as to be the ſubject of a phyſical and natural change; for, though the act may be perfect in Gods minde, yet the perſon cannot be perfectly juſtified by that act, becauſe he hath not exiſtence; can he be pardoned, and acquitted, and declared juſt, that is ſo farre from being an offender, that he never yet was a man? The act of Gods will is perfect concerning the ſanctifying of a perſon before he have a being; but he is not a ſubject capable, becauſe as yet he is not; ſo God may will Juſtification, but he cannot juſtifie (de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver him from a ſtate of damnation into a ſtate of ſalvation) till the perſon exiſt, who may be the ſubject of this change.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> Shewing that a man is not juſtified actually from the time of Chriſts death.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Shall here firſt premiſe a few things, that it may be known what we affirme, and what we oppoſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Then it is willingly granted, that Chriſt in his death was a Mediator, and ſurety, and publick perſon, and that what he did and ſuffered, was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for the benefit of the Elect.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That Chriſt in his death made a full ſatisfaction to Divine juſtice for all the ſins of the Elect, ſo that the whole ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction is made, and the price paid, and <hi>quoad meritum,</hi> the work is done; and in this reſpect he hath made an end of ſin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath fully ſatisfied for it, ſo that there need no more ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for ſin,<note place="margin">Heb. 1.3. Dan. 9.24.</note> but he hath purged our ſins away meritoriouſly by his blood.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, God is thus far well-pleaſed with this ſatisfaction of Chriſt, that in reſpect of Chriſt our ſurety, God requires no more at his hands, nor at the hands of thoſe for whom he died by way of ſatisfaction, it being the full value that his juſtice did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, By his death he obtained in the behalf of the Elect, not a remote, poſſible, conditional reconciliation, in an <hi>Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> ſenſe, as if our redemption were to be compleated by an act of our Faith, performed by the power and liberty of our own
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:118254:101"/> free-will, ſo that upon this condition to be fulfilled by us, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the aſſiſtance of grace, the fruits of Chriſts death ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend, for this had been to purchaſe for us only a ſalvability, not ſalvation, and to make us our own Saviours; but Chriſt died ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely to purchaſe ſalvation, as abſolutely is oppoſed to an <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minian</hi> ſenſe of a condition already explained; but if abſolutely be taken to oppoſe Faith, as a condition to apply Chriſts righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, by the order which God hath appointed in his Goſpel, which Faith God hath ordained as a means to bring us into poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of Chriſt and his righteouſneſſe, which faith God hath ordained his Elect unto, and Chriſt hath merited, and ſhall be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly given for this end; In this ſenſe I deny, that Chriſts death was abſolutely a diſcharge from ſin. And therefore affirme, that an Elect perſon is not actually reconciled, ſo as to be immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly juſtified, and diſcharged from the guilt of ſin from the time of Chriſts death antecedently unto faith, nor did God accept of the ſatisfaction of Chriſt for a preſent diſcharge to the ſinner; but Chriſt having laid down the price, the Father and Sonne did agree upon a way and order, when this benefit ſhall become theirs, and that not to be till actual faith, according to the tenor of the Goſpel, which promiſeth ſalvation only to him that doth believe.</p>
               <p>Having thus explained my ſelf, I now ſhall prove it by theſe following arguments.</p>
               <p>Firſt, If Chriſt did not die abſolutely for the Elect, that their ſins ſhould be pardoned, whether they believe, or not believe, then are they not actually diſcharged untill Faith: But Chriſt did not die abſolutely for the Elect, that their ſins ſhould be pardoned whether they believe or not believe: Therefore, &amp;c. As for the aſſumption, it is ſuch a ſacred truth, that none that have a ſpark of modeſty or grace left will deny; for if Chriſt have died abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they ſhall have pardon though they die in unbelief, let them ſhew this, and I will yield the cauſe; for if Chriſt had died to have the ſins of the Elect pardoned, whether they have faith or not, then an argument drawn from Chriſts ſatisfaction, and Gods accepting it ſo, would be nervous and ſtrong to prove an immediate reconciliation: but this can never be proved; for,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:118254:102"/> 
                  <hi>Without faith it is impoſſibe to</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Heb. 11.9. John 3.26. Acts 13.48.</note> 
                  <hi>pleaſe God:</hi> And, <hi>He that believeth not, the wrath of God abideth on him;</hi> And, <hi>As many as were ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to life, believe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi> And the Conſequence of the <hi>Major</hi> is proved thus; if Chriſt did not die abſolutely to diſcharge them from ſin without faith, then he died for them conditionally, that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and the benefit of his death is limited untill faith. Nor will it availe, to ſay that faith is a ſubſequent condition, not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent, which I diſprove by theſe following Arguments.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If an unbeliever remaining ſo, cannot be the ſubject of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, then Faith is not a ſubſequent, but antecedent condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Juſtification: But an unbeliever cannot be the ſubject of Juſtification; Therefore, &amp;c. The <hi>Major</hi> will not be denied where Reaſon dwells: the <hi>Minor</hi> I prove thus, becauſe the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture no where maketh an unbeliever the ſubject of Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe then Juſtification is a priviledge common to Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and unbelievers; but the Scripture peculiarly, and ſolely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth it to them that believe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Becauſe no man out of Chriſt, or diſunited can be ſaved by Chriſt, for Chriſt ſaveth none but his Members; Chriſt is called the Saviour of his Body,<note place="margin">Eph. 5.23.</note> and no unbeliever is a member of Chriſt; for as much as the myſtical union is made by Faith, for which I referre the Reader to my Sermon, and the Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Juſtification and Sanctification are inſeparably joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: But were not ſanctified from the time of Chriſts death, and antecedently to faith: Therefore we were not juſtified. It is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to experience, that Sanctification is not in the leaſt moment of time ſeparated from Juſtification; indeed we grant a prio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of nature, and order, but not of time; Hence the Apoſtle maketh all that are in Chriſt new creatures,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.17. 1 John 1.6.</note> 
                  <hi>And if any man,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>John, hath fellowſhip with God or Chriſt, and walketh in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, he is a liar, and doth not the truth;</hi> for then a man might be the member of Chriſt, and the limbe of the Devil at the ſame time; if juſtified, he is a member of Chriſt; if unſanctified, a childe of the Devil;<note place="margin">1 John 3.8.</note> 
                  <hi>He that committeth ſinne, is of the Devil;</hi> nor can it be agreeable to the purity of Chriſts Nature, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:118254:102"/> to have an unſanctified member of his body, nor will the purity and holineſſe of God the Father bear it, that any ſhould be his childe that is not holy; nor can he that is a holy God, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie a wicked wretch ſo remaining;<note place="margin">

Atqui tenendum eſt memoriâ, quod jam dixi, non ſeparari justificandi gratiam à regeneratione, licèt res ſint diſtinctae; It is contume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious and contrary to Gods nature to juſtifie thoſe that remaine wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. To which he anſwereth, But we muſt remember that which I now ſaid, the grace of Juſtification is not ſeparated from Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, although they be ſeveral things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, If we were juſtified antecedently to our birth from the time of Chriſts death,<note place="margin">Eph. 2.1, 2, 3. 1 Cor. 6.9. John 3.</note> then we were never borne ſinners un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the guilt of ſin; But this is contrary to many plain Scriptures, that ſay, <hi>we were children of wrath,</hi> and ſuch as were unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and could not in our unregeneration inherit the Kingdome of God; and for further proof, I referre the Reader to the ninth Argument againſt eternall Juſtification.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, If the ſtate and condition of a man be truly altered, and changed, and that before God upon believing, then was he not juſtified from the time of Chriſts death; But his eſtate is truly altered in the ſight of God upon believing; Hence it is ſaid, that they are his people, which once they were not, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.10.<note place="margin">1 Peter 2.10.</note> Which in times paſt were not a people, but are now the people of God; which in times paſt were not under mercy, but have now obtained mercy;<note place="margin">Hoſea 1.10. Hoſea 2.23.</note> which words are taken from the Prophet <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſea,</hi> upon which words <hi>Zanchy</hi> obſerveth, that a people are called Gods people three wayes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. According to Predeſtination, thus it's ſaid, God hath not caſt away his people which he foreknew.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In reſpect of the Covenant under the Law, and ſo the Sons of <hi>Abraham</hi> were Gods people, and they that were excluded from that Covenant, were none of his.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In reſpect to their excluſion, or admittance to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in the Goſpel, and thus the Elect Gentiles were once not a
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:118254:103" rendition="simple:additions"/> people, and then made a people to the Covenant of Grace.]</p>
               <p>And in this ſenſe I adde, all unregenerate, though Elect, are not Gods people, untill faith: And hence <hi>Zanchy</hi> ſaith thus, that whereas the words ſhould have run thus, that in the place where it is ſaid, <hi>ye are not my people,</hi> there it ſhall be ſaid, <hi>ye are my people,</hi> inſtead thereof he ſaith it is ſaid, <hi>ye are the Sonnes of God,</hi> and he aſſigneth three reaſons, the third is, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t meliùs hâc locutione indicaret rationem quâ juſtificamur, &amp; ſalvamur, nempe per fidem, verbum Dei apprehenſantem, (ſi enim filii Dei ſumus, ergò nati ex Deo, ſi nati ex Deo, ergò per ſemen Dei in nos illapſum, &amp; à nobis apprehenſum, &amp; in nobis retentum; ſemen Dei eſt verbum Evangelii in nos illabitur, per virtutem Spiritûs ſancti, à nobis verò fide, quae it idem opus eſt Spiritûs ſancti, ſolâ recipitur, ergò ſolâ fide fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus filii Dei. He ſpeaketh thus, that he may the better declare the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of our Justification, or Salvation, ta wit, by faith,</hi> apprehending the Word of God, (where he taketh faith not objectively, but ſubjectively with connotation to the object;) for if we be the ſons of God, we are therefore borne of God; if borne of God, therefore by the ſeed of God falling into us, and received, and retained by us. The ſeed of God is the Word of the Goſpel, it falleth into us by the power of the Holy Ghoſt, but of us it is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received by faith, which again is the work of the Holy Ghoſt, therfore by faith alone we are made the ſons of God; where you ſee that <hi>Zanchy</hi> maketh this great change to be by faith, and that ſuch a change is made, is evident; for before faith they are<note n="*" place="margin">Eph. 2.1, 2, 3. 2 Tim. 2.26. Acts 26, 18. Ezek. 44.7. Heb. 2.15.

               <pb n="179" facs="tcp:118254:103"/>
               <p>Fifthly, If we are exhorted to believe in God for pardon and remiſſion of ſins, then were not we pardoned from the time of Chriſts death before faith; But we are thus exhorted to believe in God for the pardon of ſins, <hi>Believe, and thou ſhalt be ſaved,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 16.31.</note> and the Scripture was written for this end that we might believe, and that believing, we might have life through his Name.<note place="margin">John 20.21.</note> The conſequence is confirmed, becauſe, if we were juſtified already before faith, it were a needleſſe exhortation to call upon us to believe for pardon, when we are pardoned already, and therefore we might be called upon to believe to get aſſurance of our pardon, but not to obtain pardon it ſelf; it were an exhorting us to ſeek for that by faith, which according to Mr. <hi>Eyre,</hi> is to be eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, not to be obtained through faith, and ſo were a needleſſe and a groundleſſe exhortation.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Such as were not myſtically united to Chriſt at his death, could not be juſtified actually by his death; But Believets that now live, were not then myſtically united; Therefore. The <hi>Major</hi> Propoſition will need no ſhield and buckler to defend it, for Chriſt juſtifieth none but ſuch as are in him; as the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> brings condemnation to none but ſuch as are in him, ſo the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Adam</hi> gives life and ſalvation to none but ſuch as are in him. The <hi>Minor</hi> is proved, becauſe that that is not, cannot be united; Believers were not then exiſting. Beſides,</p>
               <p n="2">2. This union is made by faith; They that were not exiſting, were not then believers.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Chriſts being a common perſon, is not ſufficient to make the myſtical union.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Chriſt as a publick perſon, is a ſurety; but Chriſt as united to us, is a Head, which are different conſiderations; in the one he is a meritorious, moral cauſe of ſalvation, in the other a phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical cauſe, or efficient natural cauſe.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The myſtical union is by a work of the Spirit,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6.17.</note> 
                  <hi>He that is joyned to the Lord, is one Spirit;</hi> but if the myſtical union be made by Chriſts being a publick perſon, that needeth not any new work of the Spirit to joyn Chriſt and Believers together.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Thoſe places, where it is ſaid, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.5. &amp; 6.13.<note place="margin">Epheſ. 2.5.6.13. Col. 2.13, 14.</note> &amp; <hi>Col.</hi> 2.13, 14. <hi>That we were quickened with Chriſt, and are made to
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:118254:104"/> ſit together in heavenly places: And in Chriſt Jeſus, we who were ſometimes afarre off, are now made nigh;</hi> and that the handwrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Ordinances was blotted out, ſignifie no more then that in, and through him, as a meritorious cauſe we obtain ſuch mercies, but they hold not forth Believers to be exiſting in him before they had a being; and our ſitting in heavenly places, is ſpoken only in regard of the certain right we have thereunto, <hi>jus ad rem,</hi> though not <hi>jus in re,</hi> and in a qualified ſenſe, in Chriſt our Head who is already aſcended.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, Chriſt in his death was not myſtically, but perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally conſidered: For, though he were a publick perſon, and Mediatour, yet as ſo, he was perſonally, not myſtically, conſidered in his death and reſurrection, and the Juſtification that he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from God; Therefore we were not juſtified actually from the time of Chriſts death. The Antecedent is thus made good, becauſe it was not Chriſt myſtical that was crucified, but Chriſt the Son of God; and, <hi>He trod the</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Iſay 63.3.</note> 
                  <hi>Wine-preſſe of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wrath alone;</hi> Chriſt myſticall is not the Saviout of the world, then the work of Redemption is to be attributed to every Believer, and they are as truly Saviours of the world as Chriſt; but this is blaſphemy to imagine; and therefore if he were not myſtically conſidered in his death, then not in his Reſurrection; nor in that Juſtification he received, and ſo by conſequence we were not juſtified by his death, nor were in him antecedently to faith.</p>
               <p>Eightly, If we were pardoned from the time of Chriſts death, then as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> objecteth againſt our Divines that make faith an aſſurance, then it is as abſurd to pray for pardon of ſin, as for the incarnation of Chriſt, and I may adde at for an immanent act in God, as to pray for predeſtination; becauſe, if it be a thing done already, then it is in vaine to pray for that that is done;<note place="margin">Jame<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>forgive us our ſins:</hi> Now in that prayer we do not pray, for aſſurance only, but for pardon it ſelfe. For as Mr. <hi>Burgeſs</hi> hath well obſerved to my hand, that we muſt not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from the literal ſenſe of the words without an evident ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity;
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:118254:104"/> 
                  <hi>But the plain ſenſe is, that God would forgive our ſin; our Saviour minding brevity, would ſpeak his ſenſe in the moſt perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous and clear manner, that may be. And it is not as he obſerveth ſo taken in other places, when the Prophet</hi> Iſaiah <hi>ſpeaking of the</hi> Iſraelites, <hi>How their land was full of Idols,</hi>

                  <hi>and both great men and mean men did humble themſelves before them, prayeth,</hi> Iſa. 2.9. <hi>that therefore God would not forgive them; can any imagine that he meant that God would not give them aſſurance of their forgiveneſſe? And ſo,</hi> Matth. 12.32. <hi>the Evangelist ſaith, All other ſins may be forgiven but that againſt the Holy Ghoſt: Now in that ſenſe other ſins are ſaid to be forgiven, in which ſenſe that is denied to be forgiven, and that is denied to be forgiven, not in reſpect of aſſurance, but really.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſo as he ſaith, when it is applied to men, it is not meant of aſſurance; <hi>For we are commanded to pray that God would forgive us as we forgive others, and this laſt forgiveneſſe it not meant of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance; therefore neither is the former.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ninthly, Such as are under the power of Satan are not juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; But all unbelievers are under the power of Satan; Therefore we were not juſtified from the death of Chriſt antecedently to faith. The <hi>Major</hi> is not liable to contradiction, becauſe if a man be juſtified, he is accquitted by the Judge, then what power hath the Jayler to keep him in priſon? neither will God nor Chriſt permit a ſoul under Satans power, that is diſcharged from guilt; that very act of Gods, is his deliverance from the power of Satan. The <hi>Minor</hi> is evident from Scripture, which ſaith of the Gentiles, to whom <hi>Paul</hi> was ſent by ſpecial commiſſion from Chriſt to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen their eyes; It is ſaid, that he was ſent to open their eyes, to turne them from darkneſſe to light,<note place="margin">Acts 26.83.</note> from the power of Satan unto God, that they might receive forgiveneſſe of ſins, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance among them that are ſanctified by faith in Chriſt. Where it is evident that theſe Gentiles were Elect, for whom Chriſt died, that when he was in heaven, yet appeared in a viſion to <hi>Paul,</hi> as he was going to <hi>Damaſcus</hi> to perſecute the Saints; And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts him, and then ſends him as a ſpecial Embaſſadour and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to the Gentiles to open their eyes, to turne them from dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to light, from the power of Satan to God, &amp;c. If they were from the time of Chriſts death juſtified, and pardoned,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:118254:105"/> then they were not under Satans power, for that is inconſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with Juſtification; and if they were pardoned already, what need he ſend him to open their eyes, to turne them from Satan to God, that they might receive forgiveneſſe? this was the end why he was ſent, nor can it be meant of receiving the knowledge of their pardon, aſſurance of their forgiveneſſe; but that they might receive forgiveneſſe it ſelf.</p>
               <p>And to this end alſo the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of the <hi>Epheſians, That they walked according to the Prince of the power of the aire, the ſpirit that now worketh in the children of diſobedience,</hi> intimating they were no leſſe ruled and acted by Satan, then other worldly men in whom he now effectually worketh.</p>
               <p>Tenthly, If we were juſtified from the time of Chriſts death, then the Elect Jewes are already juſtified, whom God will call in this latter age of the world: But the Elect Jewes are not yet juſtified: Therefore Juſtification is not from the time of Chriſts death. The conſequence of the <hi>Major</hi> will not be denied. The aſſumption I prove.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Such as are notingraffed as members into Chriſts body, are not juſtified: The Elect Jews yet uncaled, are not yet ingraffed into Chriſts body. The <hi>major</hi> is expreſly confirmed, becauſe Chriſt is the Saviour of his body,<note place="margin">Eph. 5.23.</note> that is, only of his body; that the Elect Jews are not members of his body,<note place="margin">Eph. 1.23.</note> I prove, becauſe they are not members of his Church, which is the body of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They that are not called, are not juſtified: But the Elect Jewes are not called. The <hi>Major</hi> is proved from <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. <hi>Whom he praedeſtinated,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 8.30.</note> 
                  <hi>them he called,, and whom he called, them he juſtified,</hi> and none elſe; and why Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> ſhould deny that the Apoſtle doth here ſet down the order of the cauſes of ſalvation, contrary to all reaſon and authority, I cannot imagine, but that he is not able to anſwer the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and the contrary may be proved out of the Text; for if in every thing elſe that relates to the ſalvation of man in this place, the Apoſtle hath obſerved the due order; why ſhould we think he hath not aſſigned the right order of Vocation, and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification? For here the Apoſtle ſetteth down the golden chain of ſalvation.</p>

               <p>For the firſt cauſe is Gods foreknowledge, not a ſimple pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience or foreſight, a foreſight of approbation, nor a foreſight of mens faith or works; but<note n="*" place="margin">Pet.

                  </gap>th, and whatſoever is needful to ſalvation. Now when the Apoſtle ſpeaketh thus, who can judge but he meanes a ſpecial order in this place?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, in the next place he ſetteth down the means, and that is effectual Vocation, <hi>Whom he predestinated, them he alſo called,</hi> that is, called them unto faith.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Whom he called, them he juſtified,</hi> that is, pardoned for Chriſts ſake, apprehended by Faith.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, <hi>Whom he juſtified, them he glorified;</hi> under which is comprehended Sanctification, which will end in glory, which is the laſt link in this golden chaine, and it's againſt all reaſon to think the Apoſtle did not intend a direct <hi>Series,</hi> and order of the cauſes of ſalvation in this place, from whence then it may be concluded, thoſe that are uncalled, are unjuſtified, ſo are the Elect Jewes. Therefore.</p>
               <p>A third reaſon is, becauſe they who are alienated from God, they are not reconciled, and by conſequence not juſtified; So are the Elect Jewes yet uncalled; Therefore, &amp;c.

               <p>Secondly, Do we ſay that faith juſtifies in an <hi>Arminian</hi> ſenſe, as if the <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>credere,</hi> the act of believing were imputed to us for righteouſneſſe, or that Faith in the Covenant of Grace ſtandeth inſtead of that obedience we owe to the Moral Law; ſo as that our imperfect faith is for Chriſts ſake accepted for perfect <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe.</p>
               <pb n="186" facs="tcp:118254:107"/>
               <p>Thirdly, Faith doth not juſtifie us as the matter of our righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, as a grace, or a work, or an act, or a habit; but the matter of our Juſtification, is Chriſts righteouſneſſe and obedience.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Faith is not to be taken objectively only, that is, for <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> interprets it, though it be willingly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that we are juſtified by no other righteouſneſſe, then the righteouſneſe of Chriſt. But,</p>
               <p>Fifthly, I take Faith ſubjectively and properly for the grace of Faith, and that act of it whereby as a hand it layeth hold upon Chriſt for Juſtification, and ſo it is to be taken with connotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to its object; That if you ask for what I am juſtified, I ſay, the only righteouſneſſe of Chriſt imputed; if you ask by what I am juſtified, I anſwer, by Faith, as an hand to put on Chriſt, as an inſtrument appointed by God to apply Chriſt, ſo that Faith is not the matter of my righteouſneſſe; but anſwereth in my participation of the righteouſneſſe in Chriſt, to that which is the ground of my being partaker in <hi>Adams</hi> ſin.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, This grace of Faith is the free gift of God, not the birth or ſpawn of free will, but the effect of Election, and a fruit of Chriſts death.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, When the Scripture ſaith, <hi>We are juſtified by faith,</hi> it is to be taken for this grace of Faith relatively conſidered as to its object; and by applying Chriſts righteouſneſſe, a Believer is juſtified really in the ſight of God by a change of his eſtate, from death to life; ſo that it doth not only declaratively evidence Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification to the conſcience, but inſtrumentally it juſtifieth us, ſo as that I muſt be juſtified by it, though I am not juſtified for it. Theſe things premiſed, I ſhall now prove it.</p>
               <p>It were needleſſe to mention the Scriptures that expreſſely ſay we are juſtified by faith, it being acknowledged that the Scripture clearly ſpeaketh ſo; but only the difference is, how this is to be taken, whether properly, metonymically, or both? to which laſt I incline in the ſenſe explained: So that neither Chriſt alone, nor Faith alone do juſtifie; but that they are ſocial cauſes, though not co-ordinate, and <hi>ejuſdem generis,</hi> of the ſame kinde or worth; but Chriſt is a morall meritorious cauſe, Faith the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental working only <hi>virtute agentis principalis,</hi> by the
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:118254:107" rendition="simple:additions"/> power, order, conſtitution of the principal agent, to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of an effect far above its own native-worth, or power.</p>
               <p>Argument the firſt, againſt declarative Juſtification; The matter in controverſie between <hi>Paul</hi> and the Juſticiaries in his time was not by what we come to the knowledge of our Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, but by what means we are juſtified; it is of farre great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er concernment to be juſtified, then to know his Juſtification; he ſaid, we were juſtified by faith, they by the Law; whence I reaſon, If faith (taken ſubjectively) for the grace of faith do only evidence Juſtification, then we are no more juſtified by faith then by works; But the Apoſtle aſcribeth more to faith then to works; Therefore faith doth more then evidence Juſtification. The conſequence is evident, becauſe works may evidence Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; nay, works are of a more declarative evidencing nature then faith; Hence the truth of faith is evidenced by works, not only to others, but to our ſelves; and that works evidence this Juſtification of a ſinner, is apparent, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1.<note place="margin">Rom. 8.1.</note> 
                  <hi>There is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus, who walk not after the fleſh, but after the Spirit; By this we know that we are paſſed, &amp;c.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 John 3.14.</note> Now the Aſſumption I confirme thus, that the Apoſtle attributes more to faith then to works, becauſe the Scripture no where ſaith we are juſtified by works in his blood, but it ſaith we are juſtified by faith in his blood; And when the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by faith, he meaneth of a Juſtification before God, as in that third to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> he concludeth by a ſound argument, that we are juſtified in the ſight of God, and not before conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: Thus, if all have ſinned, and are come ſhort of the glory of God, and ſo are inherently wicked, then we are not juſtified by what we can do; but we are all thus guilty before God, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in his ſight ſhall no fleſh living be juſtified; He ſpeaketh there a Juſtification in <hi>foro Dei,</hi> in the ſight of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If faith do only declare that we are juſtified, then <hi>Paul</hi> did not ſay true, in denying that by the works of the Law, or holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, we are juſtified; for if he ſpake of a declarative Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, he had no reaſon to deny that we are juſtified by the works of obedience done to the Law, for works of Sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:118254:108"/> do evidence this, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.3, 4. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17. 1 <hi>John.</hi> 3.14. 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.24. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.13, 14.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If when the Scripture ſaith, we are juſtified by faith, be meant only we are declaratively juſtified by faith, then we may as well ſay we are elected by faith, as juſtified by faith; becauſe faith will as truly evidence Election, as Juſtification; hence we are commanded to make our Calling and Election ſure;<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.10.</note> but the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ſaith not we are Elected by faith, or through faith, but choſen unto ſaith; therefore faith hath an influence into Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though not into Election, and ſomething more is intended then a declarative Juſtification.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Then Faith is not a believing on Chriſt for pardon, but a believing on Chriſt becauſe I am pardoned; and if ſo, then an Axiom or Propoſition, according to Mr. <hi>Eyre,</hi> is the object of juſtifying faith, contrary to all the<note n="*" place="margin">Actus cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentis non ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minatur ad axi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oma, ſed ad rem, fatentibus Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſticorum cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſſimis. <hi>Ameſii</hi> Medul. Theol. l. <hi>2.</hi> c. <hi>5 24.</hi>
                  </note> Orthodox, who make Chriſt, or the mercy of God in Chriſt, the object of Faith.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Then Faith may be neceſſary to Conſolation, but it is not neceſſary to Salvation, contrary to the Scripture which ſaith that ſalvation is the end of Faith, and we believe unto the ſaving of our ſoules.</p>
               <p n="6">6. This inverteth the order of the Goſpel, for that command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us to believe that we may be juſtified; this ſaith, we are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready juſtified, therefore we muſt believe; The Scripture ſaith, <hi>We are juſtified by faith,</hi> This opinion, as Mr. <hi>Woodbridge</hi> obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, maketh us to be faithed by Juſtification.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Then it is not lawful to pray for pardon of ſin, but for aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, the vanity of this is before diſcovered.</p>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> will object, that when the Scripture ſaith, <hi>We are juſtified by faith;</hi> the meaning is by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> taking faith ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectively, and excluſively. To which I anſwer, that we deny not faith to be taken objectively, if you ſpeak of the matter of our righteouſneſſe; but that therefore faith is excluded, and that the object juſtifie without the act; I deny, and prove thus:</p>
               <p>Firſt, It conduceth much to the beliefe of this truth, that faith is to be taken ſubjectively with connotation to its object; or that faith ſubjectively taken, is not excluded from Juſtification, becauſe the letter of the Scripture expreſſely in many places,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:118254:108"/> affirmeth that <hi>we are juſtified by faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, I conceive the matter in controverſie between <hi>Paul</hi> and the Juſticiaries, was not only preciſely, and abſtractively conſidered, what is the matter of our righteouſneſſe that God requires for our Juſtification, for then his direct anſwer had been the righ eouſneſſe of Chriſt, excluding faith, for faith is in no ſenſe the matter of our righteouſneſſe, for which we are juſtified, for then faith and works had not been oppoſed, and we were then juſtified by works; but I conceive the queſtion was, what was the matter of this righteouſneſſe, and how is this ours, as app areth by his anſwer: Now if the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt be the matter of Juſtification, and is made ours by imputation antecedently to faith, the Apoſtle did impertinently adde faith in the anſwer to the queſtions, that we are juſtified by faith in Chriſt, if that be excluded from applying Chriſts righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; for he is not ſpeaking here of a declarative Juſtification, what ſhall evidence it to my conſcience, and give me knowledge of it, but what juſtifieth me? and ſeeing it is ſomething without, done for me, and imputed, how is it mine? not, how is it known to be mine? Therefore faith is not excluſively taken.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If when it is ſaid we are juſtified by faith in Chriſt, the object is underſtood by the act, excluding the act, then why is it that in moſt places where Juſtification is ſpoken of, that the object and the act are both expreſſed, if by the object and act the ſame thing be intended?</p>
               <p>Fourthly, It is not probable that the Apoſtle in ſuch a weighty controverſie, wherein he did deſire to ſpeak clearly (and had moſt reaſon to ſpeak clearly, rather then elegantly, and obſcurely) ſhould take the act for the object, if the act had no influence into Juſtification, (neither as the matter of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor the inſtrument to apply it,) for danger might ariſe, and is given by ſuch an expreſſion, to aſcribe ſomething to faith in the point of Juſtification, if his intent were to exclude it, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he intended not to exclude it; hence we juſtly aſcribe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentality unto faith, in applying Chriſts righteouſneſſe to Juſtification.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, If <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith by which he was juſtified, was ſubjectively taken for the grace of faith, yet relatively conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to its object, then our faith that are the children of <hi>Abraham,</hi>

The aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption is proved from <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.3.<note place="margin">Rom. 4.3.</note> For firſt, beſides the letter, where it is ſaid, <hi>that it was imputed to him for righteouſneſſe,</hi> that is, his faith, believing on God, ſo that faith is deſcribed, <hi>verſ.</hi> 17. in many excellent acts of that faith, ne ther of which can in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of ſpeech be applied to Chriſts righteouſneſſe, and why the Apoſtle ſhould impertinently break out into many expreſſions in the commendation of his faith as a grace, when he is treating of the point of Juſtification, and ſtirre up us to the imitation of the like faith, telling us that it was written for our ſakes, that it was imputed to him for righteouſneſs, and that our faith (believing on God that raiſed our Lord Jeſus from the dead) ſhall be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to us for righteouſneſſe, if we ſo believe; if faith hath no hand in Juſtification, to apply Chriſts righteouſneſſe to that end, I can no way rationally imagine.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Nor can I ſee any ſupereminent excellency in that grace above all other, as the Scripture expreſſeth, and Divines ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, if its nobleſt effect of Juſtification be denied, but as works of Sanctification do as evidently declare Juſtification as Faith, as I have ſhewed; ſo the grace of love farre excelleth it in other reſpects; Therefore is it not excluſively taken in the point of Juſtification.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, Beſides in <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.5. it is ſaid, <hi>That to him that believeth, his faith is imputed for righteouſneſſe;</hi> where ſomething belonging to the Believer is called his, to wit, the act of faith, which is his before the imputation of it is made to him, and that is imputed for righteouſneſſe; that is, that act of Faith relatively conſidered, is that that gives him a title to Chriſts righteouſneſs, and ſo that that is due to Chriſt, is attributed to the act; and hence that is ſaid to be imputed for righteouſneſſe: Now that Chriſt without faith juſtifies not, I prove by theſe follow argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>

<pb n="193" facs="tcp:118254:110"/> I will not trouble the Reader with all, ſometimes it is taken for any thing which is moved, and directed by a ſuperior agent, thus the <hi>Platonists</hi> take it, and according to this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation every agent but God is an inſtrument, and God alone in this ſenſe is the principal efficient cauſe of all things; and thus <hi>Iſaiah</hi> the Prophet ſeemeth to take it,<note place="margin">Iſaiah <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="2">2. To omit the reſt, an inſtrument according to the vulgar, and uſual acceptation of it, is any thing that is uſed by the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour agent, moving, and directing it to the production of an effect ſuperior to it ſelf; for if it be proportionated to the effect, it is not an inſtrument, but an efficient principal cauſe. And I conceive five things are required to an inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall cauſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That it be a neceſſary antecedent to the effect, not a conſequent of it; and I ſay a neceſſary antecedent, to diſtinguiſh it from a contingent antecedent; not that the whole nature of an inſtrumental cauſe conſiſts in this; for a thing may be a neceſſary antecedent, and yet not a cauſe of the thing, as the opening of a mans eyes is a neceſſary antecedent to ſight, but not a cauſe of ſight, that is the eye, or the viſive faculty.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It muſt be moved, acted, and directed by the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour agent to its end, as a Carpenter uſeth his artificial inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the building of a Houſe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That it be uſed to produce an effect exceeding the efficacy, and activity of the inſtrument, ſo that the effect is more noble then the inſtrumental cauſe of it; As a Miniſter is Gods inſtrument by whom men are converted, and brought to faith; but is not called an inſtrument in reſpect of the natural birth of a childe begotten by him, becauſe in the firſt the effect tranſcends the efficacy of the inſtrument; but it is not ſo in reſpect of the natural birth, becauſe there is a proportion between the cauſe and the effect.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, It muſt be ſubſervient to the action of the principal
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:118254:111"/> agent; hence the action of the principal agent and the inſtrument is the ſame.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, That it have an influence into the effect by a proper cauſality.</p>
               <p>I will apply this to faith, only I will here adde whether it be in the nature of true cauſes, and to what cauſe it muſt be reduced, becauſe there are but foure Heads of cauſes: The Material, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall, Efficient, and Final.<note n="*" place="margin">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>pt that an inſtrument is not in the number of true cauſes, becauſe it doth not move, <hi>niſi moveatur,</hi> unleſſe it be moved: but this is not eſſential to a cauſe to move, and not to be moved; for ſo the Efficient ſhould not be a cauſe, becauſe it is moved by the end, and ſo all adjuvant ſociall cauſes ſhould be excluded; Therefore it is a true cauſe, yet not a firſt cauſe, as<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Plato</hi> &amp; <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenus,</hi> ut refert. <hi>Scheib.</hi> Met. <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 22. <hi>p.</hi> 308.</note> ſome imagine, but is reducible to one of thoſe foure Heads of cauſes, which are generally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to be as above recited; Therefore I take it to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the Efficient, and ſo it is an inſtrumental efficient cauſe, not the externall impulſive efficient cauſe of it, that is peculiar to the merits of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Now that faith is ſuch an inſtrumental cauſe I prove, becauſe all thoſe properties of an inſtrumental cauſe above cited belong to it.</p>
               <p>Firſt, It is a neceſſary antecedent unto Juſtification, as I have already proved, for without Faith no man is juſtified; it is not barely antecedent, as <hi>cauſa ſine qua non,</hi> as a cauſe without which a thing is not done, which is only preſent in the action, but doth nothing therein, and therefore is an equivocal cauſe, and that is indeed none, having nothing but the name of it, but is that by which it is done.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Faith is moved, acted, directed by GOD the ſuperiour Agent unto this end, GOD is the principall Agent in Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;<note place="margin">Acts 13.48.</note> Faith is wrought by GOD in the ſoul, for it is his gift, and directed by God to this end, to bring us to Juſtification; He hath ordained us not only to life, but to Faith, as a means to obtain it: <hi>As many as were ordained unto life believed.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">And whom <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e predeſtinated, them he alſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and whom he called, he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo juſtified.</note> And if God had not appointed Faith as a meanes to apply
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:118254:111"/> Chriſts righteouſneſſe unto Juſtification, Faith could not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſuch an effect; and God hath expreſſed his will, <hi>That he gave his only begotten Sonne, that whoſoever believeth ſhould not periſh, but have eternal life.</hi> Theſe two Propoſitions have been ſufficiently confirmed already.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That the effect, to wit, Juſtification doth exceed the efficacy, and act vity of Faith, I think none will deny; ſo if we conſider the excellency of the priviledges of Juſtification, how thereby our ſins are pardoned, we reconciled, adopted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the number of Gods children, and ſo are made coheir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s with Chriſt of eternal life; How could Faith merit or effect this? There is no proportion between this grace, and the great things received by it.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, It is ſubſervient to the action of the principal Agent; not that it is needful to God, as if he could not produce the effect without it, had it been his will and pleaſure, as a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter dependeth upon his inſtruments in working, without which he cannot build: But God judged it the fitteſt means to apply Chriſts righteouſneſſe to Juſtification, and hath given to Faith this peculiar office to apply it; ſo as that God hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded with himſelf to juſtifie none unleſſe they believe. Hence, though Juſtification be Gods act, yet Faith which he worketh, and freely giveth, is the means by which Gods eternal will and purpoſe to juſtifie, is executed, not by working any new will in God, but being that condition upon which God hath purpoſed, promiſed, and by Covenant obliged himſelf to performe it; and thus it concurreth with God, and God with it to the act of Juſtification.</p>
               <p>Fifthly and laſtly,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Ball,</hi> p. 19.</note> It hath an influence by a peculiar cauſality into Juſtification, as Maſter <hi>Ball</hi> ſaith on the Covenant of Grace, [As the eye is an active inſtrument for ſeeing, and the eare for hearing, ſo is Faith for juſtifying] Hence the Scripture frequently ſaith, we are juſtified by and through Faith, which indemonſtrably ſheweth the inſtrumentality of this grace; And although this act be nothing but a receiving, and ſo equivalent only to a paſſive
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:118254:112"/> inſtrument; God effecteth Juſtification, and paſſeth the ſentence, forgiveth the ſinner; Faith receiveth the mercy offered, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth Chriſt, and in him forgiveneſſe, and ſo believeth unto Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification. Nor do we in ſo ſaying Deify Faith, nor commit ſacriledge againſt Chriſt; the power of life and death is Gods, and he forgiveth, not Faith; Chriſt is our righteouſneſſe for which we are juſtified, Faith is not our righteouſneſſe, but an active lively inſtrument of the ſoul, wrought by God to apply this righteouſneſſe; and it is more properly called in reference to God, his work, then his inſtrument; yet as it is ſubſervient to his end or work of Juſtification, I ſee not any reaſon why it may not as fitly be called his inſtrument to our Juſtification, as any thing elſe he uſeth to produce an effect by, may be called his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, not becauſe he needs it, but becauſe he will not do it without it: And hence there is a twofold action in Faith, as in other inſtrumental cauſes; one inſtrumentall, the other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and peculiar to it ſelf. The inſtrumental action of Faith is, that it helpeth the action of God in juſtifying, becauſe now God according to his own conſtitution in the Goſpel may juſtifie; which obſerving his own order, he cannot do, untill Faith, that which is proper to it, is as it relates to the ſubject, and ſo it is an inſtrument of the ſoul to receive, and apply Chriſts righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe unto Juſtification.</p>
               <p>Nor have I aſſerted any thing in this that is inconſiſtent with the freeneſſe of Gods grace. For,</p>
               <p>Firſt, I make not Faith an uncertain effect depending upon mans free-will, upon which the act of Juſtification ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend;<note place="margin">Acts 13.48.</note> but a certain effect of Gods eternal purpoſe, and a fruit of Chriſts death, which ſhall infallibly in Gods due time be wrought: Now all Gods purpoſes of grace are free.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I make not Faith the matter of our righteouſneſſe for which we are juſtified, but aſcribe that to the active and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive obedience of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Though Faith be our act, yet is it Gods gift; and therefore ſalvation is no leſſe of grace, though by Faith, then if it were without it; and if it be an inſtrument helping the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Agent, yet being wholly wrought by God, and all the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy, and activity that Faith hath, it hath it not by any thing

               <p>Now we hold, and maintaine, God purpoſed in his eternal decree to juſtifie his Elect in time, to that end he ſent Chriſt in the fulneſſe of time to die for their ſins, that a full ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on might be given to his Divine Juſtice, as a foundation of Gods gracious act of Juſtification, which is not immanent, but tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent; and now by Chriſts death the price is paid, and we are me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritoriouſly redeemed; but it was the will of the Father and the Son, that none ſhould have actual benefit, as to a preſent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge from the guilt of ſin untill faith, which faith is not the effect of free-will, but a certaine effect of Gods decree, and fruit of Chriſts death, which ſhall be given to all the Elect for appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, and his ſatisfaction unto their actual Juſtification: By which faith we are united to Chriſt, and ſo partake of the ſaving benefits of his death.</p>
               <p>Now let the Reader judge which giveth moſt glory to God in Chriſt, his or ours.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Doth he aſcribe the whole work of ſalvation to the grace of God, and the meritorious purchaſe of Jeſus Chriſt? ſo do we. Nor,</p>
               <p>Secondly, Do we, as he falſly accuſeth us, make men moral cauſes of their ſalvation, let him prove it if he can.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Nor do we ſay that Chriſt purchaſed onely a new way of Salvation, whereby we may be ſaved, if we performe the conditions required of us; we acknowledge no condition to be performed by us by the power of free-will, but a condition as freely purchaſed and given, and as certainly beſtowed as the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation it ſelf; ſo that Chriſts death is no way rendered uncertain, or leſſe ſure.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Doth he ſay that God juſtifieth the ungodly? ſo do we; but we dare not ſay with him, that he juſtifieth the ungodly ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining under the reigning power of ſin; but whom he juſtifieth, he alſo ſanctifieth at the ſame time; for we think it diſhonourable to God, to the purity and holineſſe of his nature to juſtifie a man while he is a ſervant of ſin; The Lord is of purer eyes then to delight in an unſanct<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thirdly, He purgeth himſelf from this crime by deſcribing <hi>Antinomiſts</hi> in <hi>Auſtins</hi> time, from <hi>Eunomeus</hi> their leader, of whom St. <hi>Auſtine</hi> ſaith, <hi>Fertur uſquè ad eo, &amp;c.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>And he further ſaith of the</hi> Corinthians <hi>whom the Apoſtle called unrighteous, fornicators, adulterers, abuſers of themſelves with mankinde, &amp;c. ſuch as could not inherit the Kingdome of God,</hi>] That they had no more right unto ſalvation after faith, then before;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6.9, 10, 11.

               <p>The <hi>Arminians</hi> will ſay, (for againſt them he principally deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in that Book, and therefore oppoſeth an Arminian conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of faith, and not ours) that we take Juſtification for the ſenſe, and knowledge of Juſtification and pardon; and therefore to ſay men are juſtified by faith, it is as if we ſhould ſay, that men are then juſtified by faith when they believe, that is, when they perceive they are juſtified, when as they were juſtified before.</p>
               <p>Theſe are but fables and trifles; for to be juſtified, is more then to know we are juſtified: For,</p>
               <p>Firſt, It is the act of God abſolving, terminated in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of a ſinner, cited, and drawn to the tribunal of a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Judge, which act before this inſtant was not terminated up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the conſcience.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In this act God aſſureth the conſcience of a ſinner cited to his barre, fiducially truſting upon Chriſt, that now a full expiation is made of all his ſins.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The ſinner by a fiducial act, relying upon Chriſt as a ſufficient Saviour of Believers.</p>
               <p>But the act of God terminated upon us, cannot be a bare ſenſe, or knowledge of that act; what ſound man that hath a ſober brain, would ſo reaſon?</p>
               <p>And immediately followeth, <hi>Quamvis itaque in mente Dei peccata, &amp;c.</hi> Although therefore ſins were remitted in the minde of God from eternity, (where let the Reader obſerve, he is ſpeaking againſt the temporal and conditional decrees of <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> making God to elect upon foreſeen faith;) yet is not a man juſtified from eternity, that is, declared to be juſt in Chriſt, in his conſcience, when he is cited to Gods tribunal, (where he taketh declared to be juſt, for a tranſient act of God termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon the conſcience, fotgiving, and declaring this forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and not for a bare knowledge of this by a reflex act of faith;) for although that act of juſtifying in God, note an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent and an eternal act of God; yet notwithſtanding that act is not the whole integral and formal reaſon of the Juſtification of a ſinner, of which <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> and the Scripture ſpeaketh, <hi>Formaliter enim juſtificare, &amp;c.</hi> For, for God formally to juſtifie, is to declare actually, to wit, in a judiciall

                  <hi>I confeſſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Chriſt is the Head of the Elect, and of thoſe that are predeſtinated, but not formally of the predeſtinated: For neither are the predeſtinated as predeſtinated members of his body,</hi> (wherein he differeth from Mr. <hi>Eyre toto coelo,</hi>

               <p>Again, <hi>That union by which we are made the members of Christ, is made by faith; Therefore, as many as are Chriſts members, it is needful that they be Believers: but not all the predeſtinate, as ſoon as they are predeſtinate, do preſently prove Believers. Moreover, ſeeing a head cannot be a head in reſpect of others, before they are made members of his body, it followeth that Chriſt was not a head from eternity; ſeeing he had not a myſtical body from eternity, or members, in which reſpect he is properly called the head of his Church; ſeeing therefore, men are made members of his body by calling, whence the Church is called</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Where let the Reader obſerve that he plainly affirmeth a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinate perſon is not a member of Chriſts body, and that the myſticall union is made by faith, and ſurely none are properly juſtified or ſaved before they are members, and therefore before faith there is no Juſtification, nor Salvation.</p>

Where you may obſerve,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That as <hi>Adam</hi> derived condemnation to none but ſuch as were in him; ſo Chriſt communicateth ſalvation to none but ſuch as are in him.</p>
               <p>And, 2. That this union to Chriſt is made by Faith, hence by neceſſary conſequence none are ſaved and juſtified until faith; and he ſheweth plainly that we are not in Chriſt in a natural way, as we were in <hi>Adam,</hi> therefore he ſetteth down faith as the means, and none ſatisfied in Chriſt but Believers, therefore none are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified but ſuch; for Chriſt cannot derive ſalvation to any but ſuch as are in him, and before faith they are not in him.</p>

Neither otherwiſe can that of <hi>John</hi> be true, that faith is our victory whereby we overcome the world, unleſſe it did ingraf us into Chriſt, who is the Victor of the world.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE firſt Scripture is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing justified by faith we have peace with God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>He will have the Comma to be placed after juſtified, as thus, being juſtified, by faith we have peace with God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But firſt, This is a reading contrary to the common acceptation of the place by all men.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It offereth violence to the Text; for the ſcope of the place is to ſhew the efficacy of faith unto Juſtification, as may appear by the illative particle therefore, which hath not relation onely to the words immediately foregoing, but to the ſumme and ſubſtance of the whole Chapter; for the fourth Chapter containeth an Argument to prove Juſtification by Faith, and not by the works of the Law, drawn from the example of <hi>Abraham</hi> the Father of the faithful after this manner: By what meanes <hi>Abraham</hi> the Father of Believers was juſtified, By the ſame it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoveth his children to be juſtified, that is, all Believers; but <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>
                  <pb n="217" facs="tcp:118254:122"/> was not juſtified by any works, neither preceding nor following his faith, but by faith: Therefore we muſt look for Juſtification by faith only. In the third verſe he confirmeth the Aſſumption, becauſe <hi>Abraham believed, and it was imputed to him for righteouſneſſe,</hi> that is, his faith was imputed, not in an <hi>Arminian</hi> ſenſe, but his faith properly taken, in relation to the object, and hereupon he commendeth exceedingly the faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the grace of faith, and ſets it forth in many excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent properties, which can no way agree to the object, and then ſtirreth up us to an imitation of this faith, telling us that it was not written for his ſake only, but for ours alſo; and aſſureth us that our faith alſo ſhall be imputed for righteouſneſſe if we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; then he deſcribeth the object of this faith, God in Chriſt, as raiſing Chriſt from the dead; where he ſetteth forth the two main pillars of Faith, Chriſts Death and Reſurrection; and this is illuſtrated by Gods end in both theſe, 1. He delivered him to death for our offences, that is, to ſatisfie for our ſins.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He raiſed him again for our Juſtification, to declare he was abſolved from our ſins, and ſo had made full ſatisfaction: hence then he drawes down this concluſion, and ſhewes a new effect of faith, and ſo a new argument, <hi>Being therefore juſtified by faith, we have peace with God;</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, By what we have peace, we are juſtified: But by faith we have peace, therefore we are juſtified.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Neither can faith be taken here for the object ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding the act, but for the grace and act of faith, with relation to its object; for then we ſhall make the Text admit of a Tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tology, for the meritorious cauſe is expreſſed; Therefore, here by faith the act muſt be underſtood, for it is ſaid, <hi>Being juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by faith, we have peace through our Lord Jeſus,</hi> there Chriſt the meritorious cauſe of Juſtification is expreſſed, therefore the ſame thing is not underſtood by faith; yea, here, ſaith <hi>Beza,</hi>

               <p>A ſecond Scripture is, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.16. <hi>We knowing that a man is not juſtified by the works of the Law, but by the faith of Jeſus Chriſt, even we have believed that we might be juſtified by the faith of Chriſt, and not by the works of the Law;</hi> where Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi>'s gloſſe to evade the force of this Scripture, is, that the phraſe [that we may be] is as much as that we may be manifeſted and declared, and know that we are juſtified.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer, that the Apoſtle is not ſpeaking here of a declarative Juſtification, but of a Juſtification real before God; therefore when he ſpeaketh of not being juſtified by the Law, he meaneth not a declarative Juſtification; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when he ſpeaks of Juſtification by faith, he means not a declarative Juſtification, for then the oppoſition is not <hi>ad idem;</hi> for look in what ſenſe he taketh it in the firſt member of the oppoſition, it muſt be taken in the ſame ſenſe in the latter member; but it is nor meant of a declarative Juſtification in the firſt, therefore neither in the latter: For that neither was the queſtion between the Apoſtle and the Juſticiaries, nor could the Apoſtle ſay with truth, that works do not evidence Juſtification. As for Juſtification in <hi>foro conſcientiae,</hi> it is not Juſtification prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly, but the knowledge and aſſurance of it; Juſtification is to be conſidered as an action of God, for it is God that juſtifieth. The Apoſtle giveth an account why he and the believing Jewes did believe in Chriſt for Juſtification, becauſe they knew that they could not be juſtified by the Law: Now there is no way but by the Law, or by faith in Chriſt, therefore they did beleeve in Chriſt; where Juſtification by the faith of Chriſt, is made the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall cauſe of their believing; Now if they did therefore beleeve that they might be juſtified, how can that that was the end of their beleeving, evidence that they were juſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>fied already before they did believe? and here let the Reader obſerve, that both the act and object is expreſſed; and if as Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> ordinarily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands the object by the act, why are both expreſſed? Therefore
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:118254:123"/> the grace of Faith relatively conſidered, as apprehending Chriſts righteouſneſſe, is that by which we are juſtified.</p>
               <p>The third Scripture being, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. I have already vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated in my tenth Argument againſt eternall Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>A fourth place which he hath abuſed, is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4 22. where it is ſaid, that it ſhall be imputed to us if we beleeve, that is, faith in Chriſt ſhall be imputed to us for righteouſneſſe, as it was to <hi>Abraham;</hi> for there is but one way whereby both he and we are juſtified. Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi>'s anſwer is, That this particle <hi>[if]</hi> is not conditional, but declarative, and ſo he taketh the meaning to be this; Hereby we may know, and be aſſured that Chriſts righteouſneſſe is imputed to us if we beleeve; where obſerve that he wrongeth the ſcope of the Apoſtle, which is to encourage us to beleeve, as did <hi>Abraham,</hi> from the good effect of it; for hereby righteouſneſſe ſhall be imputed to us if we beleeve, he ſpeaketh of a future mercy to be obtained, and Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> telleth us of an aſſurance that we ſhall have, that it was done already; where he changeth the time paſt for the time preſent, and ſo overthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Apoſtles ſcope, and putteth a declarative ſenſe upon the words for a conditional; This is not to interpret Scripture, but to ſuborn the Spirit to ſerve his own turne.</p>
               <p>And hence I argue againſt him, If the imputation of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe be a thing that is not already, but ſhall be imputed if they beleeve, then the particle <hi>[if]</hi> is not declarative, but conditional: But the imputation of righteouſneſs is not a thing then done, but was to be done; Therefore. And for this the words are plaine, it ſhall be imputed if we believe.</p>
               <p>A fifth Scripture is, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.43. <hi>To him give all the Prophets witneſſe, that through his Name whoſoever believe, ſhall receive the remiſſion of ſins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He ſaith, it is not ſaid by believing we obtain remiſſion of ſins; and a little after, we obtain remiſſion by Chriſt, but we receive it by faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer, There is an ambiguity in the word obtain, if by it he underſtand we do not merit, purchaſe forgiveneſſe, we grant it, for whoever made the inſtrumental the meritorious cauſe of forgiveneſſe of ſins? but if by it he underſtand a receiving the
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:118254:124"/> remiſſion of our ſins through Chriſt, which then, and never till then was received; we ſay thus, forgiveneſſe is obtained by faith, as a cauſe to apply Chriſts righteouſneſſe for Juſtification; nor is this receiving a receiving of the knowledge of remiſſion, as a thing before done, and the knowledge of it only now obtained by faith; for it is ſaid, that by faith we receive remiſſion, not the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of remiſſion; all the Prophets teſtifie this, we receive re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, not the ſenſe of the remiſſion of ſinnes. Therefore Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi>'s interpretation is contrary to all the Prophets witneſſe. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, were we juſtified from eternity, as Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> wil have it, when by Gods eternal act this remiſſion was given, it had been an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury to God. Beſides, an improper ſpeech to ſay, All that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve ſhall receive remiſſion; They ſhould have ſaid, ye were remitted before, if ye beleeve, ye ſhall know it,</p>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h Scripture is, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.39. <hi>By him all that believe ſhall be juſtified from all things, from which they could not, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[He ſaith, that this ſheweth the excellency of the Goſpel above the Law, and that here is nothing at all of the time of Juſtification; though he affirme, that he that believeth is juſtified, yet it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not the Elect are not juſtified before faith, much leſſe that a man is juſtified by the gracious act, or habit of faith.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer, let it be granted he commend the Goſpel-ſacrifice for ſin above the ſacrifices of the Law, yet he ſaith, that by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the Law they could not be juſtified; and what they could not have by the Law, or any ſacrifice therein offeted, that may be obtained by Chriſt through faith; where if his purpoſe were to exclude faith from Juſtification, he might have ſaid only, <hi>by him we are juſtified from all this, from which ye could not be juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Law of Moſes;</hi> but he deſcribeth the perſons and the condition expreſſely; and if Believers only are juſtified, then unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers are not, and faith is neceſſary: Therefore though we be not juſtified by it, as the matter of our righteouſneſſe, yet as the inſtrument to apply it; and the Apoſtles limiting this to Believers were vaine, if unbelievers alſo were the ſubjects of it.</p>
               <p>A ſeventh Scripture to which he hath done violence, is, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. where Chriſt is ſaid to be <hi>made ſin for us, that we might be made the righteouſneſſe of God in him;</hi> where this is made the finall cauſe, why our ſin was imputed to Chriſt, that we might
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:118254:124"/> be made the righteouſneſſe of God in him, and he will have Chriſts being made ſin, and our being made the righteouſneſſe of God in him, formally the ſame act in God: <hi>For he ſaith, this phraſe</hi> [that we might be mad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>] <hi>doth not alwayes imply the final cauſe, but ſometimes the formal. And ſo his meaning is, that Chriſt was at the ſame time made ſin for us, and by that act of God we were made the righteouſneſſe of God in him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this I anſwer, Firſt, it offers violence to the Text; for that doth not ſay, that we were then made, but that we might be made the righteouſneſſe of God in him, it laid the foundation for this.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Let him aſſigne any other end that God had in this act in reſpect to us, if this were not his end; ſurely had it not been for this, God would not have imputed our ſinnes to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That which he ſaith, is manifeſtly falſe; for this phraſe <hi>[that we might be]</hi> alwayes doth expreſſe the finall cauſe, his inſtance doth not prove the thing in hand; He ſaith, <hi>That when light is let in that darkneſſe might be expelled, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of light is formally the expulſion of darkneſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer, if it be granted, this hindereth not, but that it might be the end why the light is let in, as in a roome that hath ſhuts to keep out the light, the room is dark; now let a man that deſires light open theſe ſhuts, at the ſame time the light doth phyſically expell the darkneſſe, and yet it was the end of the man in letting in the light to expel the darkneſſe.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The imputation of ſin to Chriſt and righteouſneſſe to us, are two different acts, and have two different effects, and therefore are not formally the ſame; for by imputing ſin to Chriſt, he is charged with the guilt of it, and is obnoxious to death; and the imputing righteouſneſſe to us, is a diſcharge from the guilt, and we are made capable of life: Now if this were formally our diſcharge, then we are diſcharged, and ſo made righteous before Chriſt had made ſatisfaction, even ſo ſoon as our ſin was imputed; but this is a manifeſt contradiction; for it is not Chriſts being charged with our guilt, but his making ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction that procures our diſcharge; but this is but one drop of that river of contradiction, that flows from him as from a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,

I deny that the imputation of ſin to Chriſt, and the non-imputation of it to us; If you ſpeak of a formal non-imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and diſcharge, (or elſe you ſay nothing to the purpoſe,) is but one and the ſame act in God; they are two diſtinct acts, ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated upon two diſtinct ſubjects. The firſt upon Chriſt, the ſecond upon us.</p>
               <p>Imputation of ſin to Chriſt, is a tranſient act done in time; for God did not charge Chriſt with our ſin from eternity, and every tranſient act requireth the exiſtence of the ſubject, upon which it is terminated, or produceth it, as did Creation. And therefore we that had no exiſtence, could not be the ſubjects of a formal non-imputation, which is an actuall diſcharge from it; and therefore, that which you anſwer to this objection, we were nor then, and therefore righteouſneſſe could not be imputed, by propounding another objection, <hi>Our ſins were not then, therefore they could not be imputed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer, the reaſon is not alike; for the <hi>non-exiſtence</hi> of a ſubject to whom any thing ſhould be impated, is of greater ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy to hinder the imputation, then the <hi>non-exiſtence</hi> of a ſinne; for the terme or ſubject of a tranſient act, is of abſolute neceſſity to be, or to be produced by the act; but there is no ſuch ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of the thing that is imputed, the act may be without that, but not without the other. Beſides, a ſin is a moral cauſe of puniſhment, and therefore the effect, which is puniſhment, (which is that that is meant by imputation of ſin,) is at the will of him that is moved thereby; and therefore ſometimes goeth before the cauſe, as in the death of Chriſt, for which the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs</hi> were juſtified before Chriſt had given ſatisfaction, and ſometimes after it; therefore the puniſhment might be inflicted on Chriſt before the ſin was committed.</p>
               <p>I ſhall now addreſſe my ſelf to give an anſwer to ſuch Scriptures as he hath alledged in defence of his own opinion.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.17. <hi>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>From whence he argueth, that if the well pleaſedneſſe of God, which is here declared, is terminated upon Chriſt mystical, and not
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:118254:125"/> to Chriſt perſonal, then God was well pleaſed with all his Elect, (who are Christ myſtical) when this voice came from heaven, and conſequently before many of them do believe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which I anſwer, that I take it to be, and have proved it an err<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r, to ſay that the Elect as El<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ct, are myſt cally uni ed to Chriſt; for union neceſſarily pre-requireth exiſtence, and Chriſt had not a myſtical body from eternity.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I deny, as then I did, the aſſumption, and ſay the well-pleaſedneſſe of God was terminated upon Chriſt perſonal, and not Chriſt myſtical: And the meaning is, This is my beloved Son in whoſe perſon I am well pleaſed, and with whoſe work and office as a Mediator I am well pleaſed; but it was not the intent of God there to ſay, for his ſake I am actually well pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with all the Elect, antecedently to their faith.</p>
               <p>Now I prove it was ſpoken of Chriſt perſonal, and not Chriſt myſtical.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If Chriſt conſidered as Mediatour be perſonally conſidered, then this is underſtood of Chriſt perſonal, and not Chriſt myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call: The antecedent is true: Therefore the conſequence. The reaſon of the conſequence is, becauſe this is ſpoken of Chriſt as Mediator; But Chriſt myſtical is not the Media<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>our of the world, for then we have ſo many Redeemers and Saviours of the world, as are united to Chriſt, and then <hi>Christ alone did not tread the winepreſſe of his Fathers wrath.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Chriſt myſtically conſidered, was not baptized by <hi>John:</hi> But this beloved Son in whom God was well pleaſed, was baptized by <hi>John:</hi> Ergo.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This was terminated on him, to whom the Heavens were then opened, and upon whom the Spirit deſcended like a Dove: But this is true only of Chriſt perſonally, not myſtically con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This voice was terminated on him, for whoſe ſake God is well pleaſed with ſuch as believe; But God is not well pleaſed with believers for the ſake of Chriſt myſtically conſidered, but perſonally; <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. This voice is terminated upon him, who is by a peculiar generation and Sonſhip ſo a Son, that it is incommunicable unto others; But this belongs only to Chriſt perſonal; Therefore this
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:118254:126"/> voice was not terminated upon Chriſt myſtical.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Now to all this I adde this, that the conſideration of Chriſt as a pub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ick Mediatour is not ſufficient to denominate him to be a Head, and the Elect his Members, ſo as to make a myſtical uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion between them, it may conſtitute him a publick perſon and ſurety; but to make him a Head myſtically united to any, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth the exiſtence and faith of the perſon united. Now where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as you ſay that Mr. <hi>Woodbridge</hi> did uncivilly interpoſe, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, or elſe you had urged more; it is to make the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve I could not anſwer you; whereas you could drive on your Argument no further by a new Medium: and then you appealed to the people, which occaſioned that interpoſition you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of.</p>
               <p>And here I ſhall anſwer to ſuch Arguments as you uſe, <hi>p.</hi> 124, 125. to prove, it was terminated to Chriſt myſticall.</p>
               <p>Your firſt is drawn from the authorities of <hi>Muſculus, Calvin, Beza, Pareus;</hi> None of all which acknowledge no more then that it teſtifies that great love of God, in whom God is well pleaſed with ſuch as believe, ſhewing the only way of appeaſing God, and reconciling God to man; but none of them do affirme Gods actual well-pleaſedneſſe with any perſons before faith, but that Chriſt is he by whom Gods wrath is turned away, as the only Mediatour to reconcile God and man; but none did afore you dream, that this Son in whom God was well pleaſed was the myſtical Chriſt, or that this voice was terminated upon Chriſt myſtical.</p>
               <p>Secondly, You ſay it is againſt the ſcope of the words to limit them to the perſon of Chriſt, they being a ſolemne declaration of Chriſts inveſtiture into his office of Mediatorſhip; We grant it is a ſolemne inauguration, or inſtalme. of Chriſt in this office, but deny your conſequence, that becauſe Chriſt is here conſidered as Mediatour, therefore, what is ſo ſpoken to him, is termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated to Chriſt myſtical, (though it might be ſpoken for th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ir be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit and comfort that ſhall believe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, You ſay there is no reaſon why thoſe words ſhould be terminated to the perſon of Chriſt, ſeeing that God was never diſpleaſed with him; nor had our Saviour any doubt or ſuſpition of it, and therefore it was needleſſe that God ſhould
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:118254:126"/> declare his well-pleaſedneſſe to him in his own perſon.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, this was ſpoken for to ſatisfie us, that Chriſt was a Mediatour well fitted for this work, that God was well pleaſed in him as one endued with ſufficient ability to reconcile; and God was well pleaſed with him, becauſe he never diſpleaſed him; and therefore was the more fitting perſon for this worke; and therefore though it be granted Chriſt needed not this teſtimony, and that it was ſpoken as an encouragement to us to believe in him: Yet it followeth not that therefore God was well pleaſed with us for his ſake before we believe, becauſe he is well pleaſed with Chriſt, and his Mediatory work.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, You ſay the well-pleaſedneſſe of God is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended unto them, for whom Chriſt offered up his ſacrifice: But Chriſt did not offer up his ſacrifice for himſelf. I deny your <hi>Major,</hi> and do ſay, that in this voice God did declare for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit and comfort of them that do believe that God was well pleaſed and ſatisfied with Chriſt, and his Mediatory work, that they may know they believe on him who is a perſon in whom, the Lord taketh infinite delight; and therefore he being ſo dear to God, they ſhall finde favour for his ſake that believe; but that therefore he is actually well pleaſed with them, whether they believe or not, yea, when they live under the power of ſinne, I take it to be no leſſe then preſumptuous boldneſſe to determine, and it carries a ſpirit of contradiction to the whole Goſpel.</p>
               <p>And to this end the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God,</hi> Heb. 11.6. To which you ſay, the Apoſtle ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth there of mens works, and not of their perſons.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, it is manifeſtly falſe; for he ſpeaketh of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, as well as of their works. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. He ſaith, by faith the Elders received a good report, that is, all of them in general; but with whom were they thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported of? ſurely by God himſelf; hence he declared his thoughts of them, thus <hi>Abraham</hi> is called the friend of God; and <hi>Noah,</hi> Thee only have I found righteous; and <hi>David</hi> is called a man after Gods own heart.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In particular <hi>Abel,</hi> he by faith offered a more excellent ſacrifice then <hi>Cain,</hi> by which he obtained teſtimony that he was righteous; God did not teſtifie only that his action was righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, but that he was a righteous perſon, and ſo <hi>Enoch,</hi> by
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:118254:127"/> faith was tranſlated, &amp;c. and he received this teſtimony that he pleaſed God, that is, that his perſon pleaſed God, for would God tranſlate him to heaven for a righteous action, if his perſon had not pleaſed God? And the very ſcope is to prove that he was a Believer, and by conſequence that his perſon did pleaſe; for without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God, and ſo Mr. <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins,</hi> and all Interpreters that I know ſpeak of it. Beſides, is it poſſible that mens act<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ons can pleaſe, where their perſons pleaſe not? Surely no, God had firſt reſpect to the perſon of <hi>Abel,</hi> then to his offering; and he had no reſpect to <hi>Cain,</hi> and then he regarded not his offering, therefore their perſons as well as their works did pleaſe, and both by faith; for let their actions be never ſo conformable to the rule, unleſſe their perſons be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, their ſervices cannot be accepted, and their beſt actions being mixt with ſinne, need Chriſt, and muſt be accepted through Chriſt, as well as their perſons. And whereas a little after you make an Elect perſon to be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to God, but none of his actions; it is altogether againſt reaſon, to imagine that a tree ſhould be good, that never did, nor can bring forth good fruit; and if all the ſins, of the Elect, be pardoned, becauſe they are juſtified, what is there in their actions wherewith God can be diſpleaſed, when their want of faith and conformity to the rule is pardoned?</p>
               <p>Secondly, thoſe Scriptures which are uſually alledged by him and others of that opinion for eternal Juſtification, are princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally theſe two, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.4. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9, 10. In the firſt it is ſaid, <hi>God choſe us in Chriſt before the foundation of the world;</hi> and in the 6th. verſ. <hi>He hath made us accepted in his Beloved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer, It is one thing to ſay, <hi>God did chuſe us in Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the foundation of the world,</hi> and another to ſay, <hi>God juſtified us, and reconciled us:</hi> Gods Election denotes Gods will of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to juſtifie and reconcile, and is <hi>terminus diminuens, amor ordinativus,</hi> not <hi>collativus;</hi> it is a terme of diminution, and doth not actually collate the things purpoſed; it is true, that Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and Reconciliation, is a fruit of Gods Election, but it is not coeternal with it; and when it is ſaid, <hi>he choſe us in Chriſt,</hi> this, as I have ſhewed by the teſtimony of Dr. <hi>Twiſſe,</hi> doth not denote any exiſtence that we then had in Chriſt, but only the
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:118254:127"/> way and means by which we obtain the things purpoſed in Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, to wit, in Chriſt, or for Chriſts ſake. And therefore as it is not ſaid, that we were ſanctified from eternity, though he choſe us in Chriſt, that we ſhould be holy; ſo neither are we juſtified from eternity, for there is no difference, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a man cannot be the ſubject of a moral change, to paſſe from a ſtate of death and life, till he do exiſt, (though he may be predeſtinated to be the ſubject of ſuch a change in time) any more then he can be the ſubject of a phyſical or natural change. Nor doth that paſſage in the 6th. Verſe confirme it, where it is ſaid, <hi>He hath made us accepted in the Beloved;</hi> for that is to be underſtood of the Elect <hi>Epheſians,</hi> as they were now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, and not to be referred to Gods eternall purpoſe. And all this is made more manifeſt, in that thoſe that were Elect, and choſen in Chriſt, are ſaid to be <hi>children of wrath, without God, without Chriſt, and without hope in the world,</hi> which, as we have ſhewed, is inconſiſtent with the ſtate of Juſtification.</p>
               <p>The ſecond place in <hi>Timothy,</hi> where it is ſaid,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 1.9, 10.</note> 
                  <hi>That grace was given us in Chriſt before the world began; but is now made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt by the appearing of our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> holds forth no ſuch thing as eternal Juſtification; but grace is ſaid to be given in reſpect of the firmneſſe, and immutability of Gods purpoſe: Therefore in this place, Gods giving is not an actual collation, but an eternal preparation of grace to be given infallibly to the Elect. And thus <hi>Auguſtinus, Apoſtolus datam dixit gratiam,</hi>

<pb n="228" facs="tcp:118254:128"/> then reconciled, then was he not reconciled from eternity.</p>
               <p>That in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.7. <hi>In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveneſſe of ſins,</hi> ſignifieth nothing but that the price of redemption was paid by him, and we have forgiveneſſe of ſins, becauſe it is purchaſed for us, but it is not actually given: For although Chriſts death be the meritorious cauſe of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet is it not the only cauſe; and therefore we are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually juſtified, till all thoſe cauſes be actually, which have an influence into it;<note place="margin">Col. 1.20, 21.</note> and that in <hi>Col.</hi> 1.20, 21. ſignifies no more, but that peace is thus farre made by the blood of his Croſſe, that now the cauſe of enmity is removed by a ſatisfaction made by the death of Chriſt, and God is now willing to forgive ſuch as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; whence he addeth, theſe mercies named ſhall be enjoyed if they continue in the faith grounded,<note place="margin">Ver. 23.</note> and ſetled, and be not moved from the hope of the Goſpel.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. This is <hi>petitio principii,</hi> a begging the queſtion, to ſay, God did accept it ſo as he did not impute ſin to us, (that is, at the ſame time when our ſins were imputed to Chriſt.)</p>
               <p n="2">2. I adde, that Gods imputing ſin to Chriſt, is virtually a non-imputing it to us; but not formally, and therefore not a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall Juſtification.</p>

               <p>I anſwer then, by denying the conſequence: For, in the firſt place, payment of a debt is refuſable when it is not the ſame in the obligation; but now if there were nothing elſe to ſay, but this, this were enough to prove it not the ſame; <hi>dum alius ſol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But ſecondly, if a ſurety of our own appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment pay the debt, then it may alſo be available, but the ſurety is provided by God, and not by us. And thirdly; he paid not the ſame, but the value. Fourthly, beſides, Chriſts death was meritorious for the diſcharge of another; not only by the intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecal
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:118254:129"/> value, but by the conſtitution of God; for if God had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained it, it might have been efficaciouſly ſufficient, even for the Reprobate; Therefore as <hi>Scotus</hi>

Seeing Chriſts death ſhall be as effectuall to all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents and purpoſes, and as certainly applied, as if preſently the benefit were obtained, for faith alſo is merited, and ſhall be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: And God did ſuſpend it till faith, as that which in his wiſdome he ſaw moſt convenient.

                  <hi>CHAP. XI.</hi> Containing an anſwer to thoſe Arguments Master <hi>Eyre</hi> hath brought to prove the antecedency of Juſtification to faith, that we are actually reconciled from the time of Chriſts death, and that faith is not an antecedent condition of Juſtification.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Irſt he ſaith, that the Eſſence and Quiddity of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification conſiſteth in the will of God not to puniſh, and that he endeavoureth to prove by two Arguments.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe the definition which the Holy Ghoſt gives of Juſtification, is moſt properly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to this act; and (ſaith he) it is a certain rule, <hi>Cui convenit definitio, convenit definitum,</hi> that is Juſtification, to which the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of Juſtification doth agree. Now, ſaith he, the definition which the Pſalmiſt and the Apoſtle gives of Juſtification, is Gods not imputing ſin, and his imputing of righteouſneſſe.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer by acknowledging the Argument; but I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that the non-imputing of ſin, and the imputation of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe is the whole definition of Juſtification; but it is a non-im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting of ſin, and imputing of righteouſneſſe according to the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Goſpel, by vertue of that ſignal promiſe, <hi>He that believes ſhall be ſaved:</hi> And this is intended by the Pſalmiſt and Apoſtle, if it be a full definition; for Juſtification is a forenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, judicial act; now according to the tenour of the firſt Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:118254:130"/> which requireth perſonal and perfect obedience, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaved: Now God hath made a new Covenant with us by Chriſt revealed in the Goſpel, wherein he hath promiſed, <hi>whoſoever believe ſhall be ſaved:</hi> Now when God as a fruit and effect of this Covenant, doth not impute ſin, and impute righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe to a perſon, this is truly Juſtification; but thus God dealeth with none untill actual faith.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I anſwer, Gods eternal purpoſe is not formally a non-imputing of ſin, but a purpoſe of not imputing it: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore till this purpoſe be brought into act, we are not pardoned and juſtified; for although his will be actuall, yet his non-impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is not actual, but to be done in time; for neither is the ſin in actual being, which how it can be remitted before it be committed, let him ſhew; for it is not actually, but <hi>potentially</hi> a ſin; And therefore, in what ſenſe it is a ſin, in that ſenſe it is remitted onely, and neither is the ſinner to be pardoned in actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all being, but Juſtification is a change of the ſtate and condition of the perſon juſtified, paſſing him from death to life, and that for Chriſts ſake; but how can the ſtate of the ſinner be changed, who is yet unborne? and never was yet actually a childe of wrath? and Chriſts death is not the cauſe of Gods eternal will and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; and conſequently, if that be Juſtification, we are juſtified without the merits of Chriſt, and then <hi>Socinian</hi> doctrine takes place; but the Scripture expreſſely mentions Chriſts death as the cauſe of our Juſtification, for which God juſtifieth us; <hi>In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveneſſe of ſins;</hi> and, <hi>God hath ſet him forth a propitiation through faith in his blood;</hi> and for Chriſts ſake God is ſaid to forgive the <hi>Epheſians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Whereas you, ſay the words, (both in the Old and New Teſtament,) whereby imputation is ſignified, which are</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>do both of them ſignifie an act of the minde and will, an immanent act.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer, that ſometimes when they are related to men, they ſo ſignifie;<note place="margin">Gen. 15.6. Gen. 38.15. Numb. 18.17. Pſal. 32.1. Pſal. 106.31. Rom. 4.6, 8.</note> yet that they are ſo taken, when attributed to God, I abſolutely deny; but do alwayes hold forth a tranſient act, and not an immanent act; as, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.6. <hi>Gen.</hi> 38.15. <hi>Numb.</hi> 18.27. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.1. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 106.31. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.6, 8. 3 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. nor can any place be produced relating to God as his act, where it is ſo taken;
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:118254:130"/> for it will aſcribe a fallible judgement unto God, to ſay that he imputeth not ſin to a juſtified perſon, that is to ſay, he judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and eſteemeth them not to have ſinned, for Gods judgement is according to truth; and therefore ſuch as have ſinned, he looketh upon them as ſuch as have ſinned, and he cannot eſteem them ſuch, as never did ſin; though he may, if he will pardon them deal with them as with ſuch as have not ſinned, and in this ſenſe he imputeth it not when he pardoneth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, His ſecond Argument is thus, <hi>That which doth ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure men from wrath, and whereby they are diſcharged, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted from their ſins, is Juſtification. By this immanent act of God all the Elect are diſcharged, and acquitted from their ſins, and ſecured from wrath and deſtruction: Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which I anſwer, 1. By diſtinguiſhing upon your <hi>Major</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, that which doth ſecure preſently, actually, fully, and formally, from wrath without any other cauſe intervening, is Juſtification. And then in taking the Propoſition thus, I deny the <hi>Minor,</hi> that Election doth preſently, actually, fully, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally diſcharge the ſinner from guilt and wrath; it is but a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in God to do it, the ſinner is not thereby diſcharged; Hence as ſoon as he is borne, he is a childe of wrath, which he could not be, if he were juſtified from eternity, and ſo continueth untill faith; and the death of Chriſt is a neceſſary cauſe intervening between this decree, and the diſcharge, for which he is diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and without which, (ſuppoſing the decree, he cannot be ſecured from wrath,) and Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> himſelf acknowledgeth, <hi>p.</hi> 140. that ſin lay as a block in the way, that God could not <hi>ſalvâ juſtitià,</hi> beſtow upon the Elect thoſe good things intended in Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: How then did Gods decree ſecure them from wrath, if he mean only eventually, it doth ſecure, becauſe they ſhall not have ſin imputed to the condemnation of their perſons; this is true, but to little purpoſe, to prove a preſent formal diſcharge, ſuch as Juſtification is: Therefore when the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect?</hi> The Apoſtle doth not ſpeak of the Elect <hi>antecedenter,</hi> antecedently to their faith; but <hi>executivè,</hi> or <hi>conſequenter,</hi> as it is executed, and compleated in thoſe that are Elected, as Mr. <hi>Burgeſſe</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Mr. <hi>Burg.</hi> of Juſtif. p. <hi>186.</hi>
                  </note> hath obſerved; Therefore, by the Elect he meaneth the Elect Believers, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:118254:131"/> if you reſolve it either into a univerſal negative, No Elect perſon can be juſtly charged with ſin, or a univerſal affirmative, all Elect perſons are free from the charge of ſin, if by the Elect, you underſtand the Elect before Faith and Regeneration, both Propoſitions are abſolutely falſe, for otherwiſe Chriſt could not have been charged with our ſin, if Election did free us from the charge, then was there no neceſſity of Chriſts dying, and then no perſon is borne a ſinner that is an Elect perſon, nor was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver under condemnation, then neither was <hi>Adam</hi> a ſinner un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der condemnation, for I take him to be an Elect perſon, and then no man ever was under condemnation, for we receive not guilt from him, unleſſe he alſo were guilty, and we in him: But if you take it for Elect Believers, then both Propoſitions are true, and this is agreeable to the ſcope of the place; for he had ſaid a little before, <hi>Whom he predeſtinated, them he called, and whom he called,</hi> (that is, unto faith,) <hi>them he juſtified.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>His anſwer to this is that they are not confounded, becauſe Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction includes both the end, which is the glory of Gods grace, and all the means from the beginning to the ending, conducing thereunto; his will not to puniſh, includes preciſely, and formally only ſome part of the meanes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this I anſwer; that according to Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi>'s opinion, there is no diſtinction at all between Election and Juſtification; for if it be the ſame act of Gods will, if the object be the ſame, if the end of God in both be the ſame, if the means conducing to that end be the ſame, then is there no difference at all according to him; bur the antecedent is true, Ther<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="235" facs="tcp:118254:131"/> the end is the ſame, the glory of Gods grace in both, and that the means conducing to that end is the ſame; Let him that hath but a ſparke of reaſon judge, for if the act be the ſame, the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the ſame, and the end the ſame in both; why the meanes ſhould not be the ſame, no reaſon can be imagined, and let him aſſigne what means God hath appointed for the execution of the eternal Election, and we ſhall eaſily ſhew it that the ſame thing God hath appointed as a neceſſary <hi>Medium</hi> to effect our Juſtification (according to his opinon,) which hold it to be one and the ſame eternal act of his will: And let the Reader obſerve, that he maketh no cauſe of our Juſtification, but Gods own eternal good will and pleaſure, as in the caſe of Election, for Chriſts death with him is not the cauſe of the act of Juſtification, but of the effects of it, of the thing willed, and ſo Chriſts death with him is no antecedent meanes to effect the act of Juſtification, but a ſubſequent mea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               <p>As for thoſe arguments which he uſeth to diſprove that our faith,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>pag.</hi> 52.</note> or faithful actions, are that Evangelical righteouſneſſe, by which we are juſtified, maketh nothing againſt me: For, if we ſpeak of our Evangelical righteouſneſſe, that is the matter of our righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, or that for which we are juſtified, I acknowledge it is wholly in Chriſt <hi>ſubjective,</hi> and it is ours only by imputation, and that faith is but the inſtrument to apply this; as for that Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend<note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>The next File of Arguments that he brings up againſt our cauſe, we finde in the 9th Chapter, which though he will have them give fire, yet they do no execution, nor will they ſtand the Field, and abide the ſhock of a ſolid anſwer; which, becauſe they are a company of tame Souldiers, we will take them priſoners, and
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:118254:132"/> ſee how they will abide to be examined. He ſaith, that faith doth not juſtifie as a condition required on our part to qualifie for Juſtification.</p>
               <p>Where I premiſe, that we underſtand not by qualifying us for Juſtification any moral diſpoſing, and qualifying us <hi>ſenſu ponti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficio,</hi> in the Papiſts ſenſe, inchoating our Juſtification, as if we were to be juſtified by ſomething inherent in us; but by qualify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we mean nothing but this, that according to the tenour of the Goſpel and New Covenant, it makes us ſubjects capable of the act of Juſtification, for as much as the condition required is now fulfilled; and as faith is Gods gift, ſo it is a paſſive condition; as it is our act, ſo it is an active inſtrument, not elicited by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of free will, but by aſſiſtance of ſpecial grace,) whereby we apprehend Chriſts righteouſneſſe for Juſtification, and in this ſenſe we are juſtified by faith according to the Scriptures. Now let us conſider his Arguments.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>That Interpretation of the phraſe, which gives no more to faith in the buſineſſe of our Juſtification, then to other works of Sanctification, cannot be true, becauſe the Scripture doth peculiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attribute our Juſtification unto Faith in way of oppoſition to other workes of Sanctification; but to interpret Faith meerly thus, that it is a condition to qualifie us for Juſtification, gives no more to Faith then to other works of Sanctification.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We ſhall reverence the <hi>Major,</hi> and let it go; but muſt commit his <hi>Minor</hi> to the Marſhalſie as a Rebel againſt reaſon: For though we make Faith a condition, and a paſſive condition in the ſenſe explained, yet this hindereth not, but that it may be an inſtrumental cauſe of Juſtification, and in this ſenſe we give more to faith, then to other works of Sanctification; Beſides, we make not as he affirme works neceſſary antecedents to Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, neceſſary antecedents to Salvation we do, but not unto Juſtification: For we acknowledge that of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> to be true, <hi>opera non precedunt juſtificandum ſed ſequuntur juſtificatum.</hi> And now I ſhall retort this Argument upon himſelf, That Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the phraſe, which giveth no more to faith in the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Juſtification then to other works of Sanctification, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be true, becauſe the Scripture doth peculiarly attribute our Juſtification unto Faith in a way of oppoſition to other works of
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:118254:132"/> Sanctification; but to interpret Faith (ſubjectively taken,) thus, that it juſtifieth us only, becauſe it evidenceth our Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is to attribute no more to faith then to other works of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification: <hi>Ergo.</hi> If he anſwer that faith ſubjectively taken, for the grace of faith is not oppoſed to works, becauſe it is a work.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, 1. If it be a work, yet it is the work of God, and not ours.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It juſtifieth not as a work, but as an inſtrument to apply Chriſts righteouſneſſe: Nay,</p>
               <p n="3">3. I ſee not but the oppoſition ſtand as ſtrongly, as if he took faith objectively for Chriſts righteouſneſſe, or obedience; for certainly the matter of our Juſtification, is the obedience of Chriſt to the Law, and ſo we are juſtified by works properly in the perſon of another.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>That Interpretation which gives no more to faith then to works of nature, ſuch as are found in natural unregenerate men, is not true, but to interpret faith a neceſſary antecedent of our Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, gives no more to faith then to works of nature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I deny the <hi>Minor;</hi> for, <hi>conditio ſine quà non,</hi> a condition, whithout which a thing is not done, may be a neceſſary conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; yet it is not ſo neceſſary as that is, which is a cauſe by which the thing is done; the eye-lids muſt be opened as a neceſſary antecedent unto ſight, But will you therefore ſay, it is as equally neceſſary as the eye it ſelf; ſo it is in the preſent caſe, ſight of ſin, ſorrow for it are neceſſarily required in the ſubject where God will work faith; but it followeth not that they are as equally neceſſary, and have as much influence into Juſtification, as Faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The third Argument is this, That by which we are juſtified, is the proper efficient meritorious cauſe of our Juſtification, but Faith conſidered as a paſſive condition, is not a proper efficient cauſe of Juſtification.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer, by diſtinguiſhing upon the word <hi>[by].</hi> That by which we are juſtified, as the material cauſe of our Juſtification, or the matter for which we are juſtified, is the meritorious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per efficient cauſe of Juſtification, and in this ſenſe we are not juſtified by faith.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It may be taken for the inſtrument by which that righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe for which we are juſtified is apprehended and applied, and
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:118254:133"/> in this ſenſe we are juſtified by faith, and taking it in this latter ſenſe, I deny the <hi>Major:</hi> Nor is faith only the inſtrumental cauſe of Juſtification, in <hi>foro conſcientiae,</hi> as a little after you affirme, though it be taken properly for the act of believing; but in <hi>foro Dei,</hi> nor a bare condition without which, but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition by which, by vertue of Gods Covenant it is obtained; and therfore I acknowledg a true cauſality in faith unto Juſtification.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>That which maketh us concurrent cauſes in the form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all act of Juſtification with God and Chriſt, becauſe our Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in reſpect of efficiency, is attributed to them, is not true, but to make faith morally diſpoſing us to Juſtification, maketh us concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent cauſes with God and Chriſt in our Juſtification.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer, 1. He attributeth more to us then we affirme; we ſay not that faith doth moraly diſpoſe us to Juſtification as he tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it in the Argument, [it is no meritorious moving cauſe of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, nor is all moral diſpoſition a morall cauſality.]</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Major</hi> is not univerſally true, for Faith is a ſocial cauſe, but not a co-ordinate cauſe of Juſtification; Beſides, what Faith doth, it doth it, <hi>virtute agentis principalis,</hi> and by vertue of Gods Covenant, not as our act, nor by any inherent worth in it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Nor doth it follow from hence, that if any condition be required in order to our Juſtification, then it is not free, for the very condition is freely given, nor is it left to be performed by the power of our free-will, this would hinder the freeneſſe of Juſtification.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is not denied that we are concurrent cauſes with the merits of Chriſt, but Chriſt and Faith are not cauſes <hi>ejuſdem generis;</hi> for Chriſts righteouſneſſe is that for which we are juſtified, Faith is only that whereby this righteouſneſſe is received, and applied unto Juſtification.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>That Interpretation which makes Works going before Juſtification, not only, not ſinful, but acceptable to God, and prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratory to the grace of Juſtification, is not according to the minde of the Holy Ghoſt; but to interpret Juſtification by faith, that faith is a condition, which doth qualifie us for Juſtification, neceſſarily ſuppoſeth a work, or works which have not the nature of ſin, but are acceptable to God, and preparatory to grace.</hi>
               </p>

               <p n="1">1. We ſay, Faith doth not us qualifie as an inherent diſpoſition, preparing us for a Juſtification, to be effected by it as an inherent grace, only it puts the ſubject into a capacity of being actually ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, according to the tenour of the Covenant.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Faith doth not juſtifie as a Work, but as an inſtrument to apply Chriſts righteouſneſſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Though Faith be a Work, it is not ours, but Gods; and therefore none of our Works juſtifie.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Though there be a priority of nature in Faith unto Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, yet there is not any priority of time; but the ſame mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that Faith is wrought, we are juſtified.</p>

               <p>In the next place we ſhall conſider his Arguments, which he bringeth in the 14th.

Now becauſe theſe Arguments are his <hi>Triarii,</hi> his Souldiers in the rere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in which he puts moſt confidence; if we can but rout theſe, the day will be our own.</p>
               <p>His firſt Argument runs thus, <hi>There is no ſuch Covenant doth appear,</hi> Ergo <hi>there is none.</hi> A negative Argument I acknowledge in matters of great conſequence, is availeable; Therefore I deny his Aſſumption and all thoſe Scriptures, which promiſe Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon believing, and that limit the benefit of Chriſts death un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ill faith, is proof enough to prove there was a Covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Father and Chriſt to ſuſpend the benefits of Chriſts death untill faith, but becauſe he will ſee the place; we referre him to <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.10. <hi>When thou ſhalt make his ſoul an offering for ſin, he ſhall ſee his ſeed, he ſhall prolong his dayes, and the pleaſure of the Lord ſhall proſper in his hand. He ſhall ſee the travel of his ſoul, and be ſatisfied; by his knowledge ſhall my righteous ſervant juſtifie many, for he ſhall bear their iniquities.</hi> Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth this place holds forth the Covenant between God and Chriſt about the effects of his death; if you take the words as a prediction of the Prophet, they hold forth a promiſe of God to Chriſt of the fruit of his death, when God ſhould <hi>make his ſoul an offering for ſin,</hi> or when his ſoul ſhall make it ſelf an offering for ſin, for the words will bear it: Now this promiſe is virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally a Covenant, and doth not limit the benefits of his death to the preſent time; but firſt preſuppoſeth this work to be done, and then as a fruit of this, <hi>he ſhall ſee his ſeed,</hi> (not all his ſeed preſently,) but he ſhall ſee it, and prolong his dayes; the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noun
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:118254:134"/> is wanting, and therefore the words have a twofold ſenſe given them; ſome expound them of Chriſt, who after his Reſurrection ſhould die no more, others of his iſſue, and race of the Saints, and ſay the Authors of our Engliſh Annotations, the ancient Greek and old Latine go both that way, and ſo take the meaning, <hi>he ſhall ſee his ſeed</hi> that ſhall prolong its dayes, with a ſupply of the relative, and if ſo, this maketh clear againſt Maſter <hi>Eyre;</hi> But however, take it which way you will, there is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to evince it; <hi>He ſhall ſee of the travel of his ſoul, and be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied,</hi> that is, he ſhall ſee that as the fruit and effect of his death, which ſhall give him full content, he ſhall be much refreſhed, and gladded as a woman after hard travel, that ſeeth the fruit of her womb, and he ſhall live to ſee it. And then follow the words, which are the words of God delivered as in his perſon, for Chriſt was not the Prophets ſervant, <hi>But by his knowledge ſhall my righteous ſervant juſtifie many,</hi> that is, by the knowledge of him, not his knowledge taken ſubjectively, but objectively, that is, the knowledge whereby they know him; where knowledge is put for faith, as, <hi>This is life eternal to know thee the only true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent;</hi> and ſo <hi>Paul</hi> counted all things loſs for the excellency of the knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt his Lord. Now here God deſcribeth how Chriſt ſhall juſtifie many by his knowledge, or by faith on him: Whence I argue, If God in the Covenant made with Chriſt, did mention faith as a means by which he ſhould juſtifie many, that is, all his ſeed that ſhould be the travel of his ſoul; then was there ſuch a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, that the fruits and benefits of Chriſts death ſhould not be enjoyed untill faith; for it is added, <hi>that he ſhall bear their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities;</hi> not that this ſhould be a preſent diſcharge, but to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie that none elſe but Believers ſhould be pardoned, becauſe he ſhall bear their ſins, and theirs only; but if they be juſtified before faith, then he beareth the ſins of unbelievers, and ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers, and Believers are the ſubjects of Juſtification contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Scriptures. But God made ſuch a Covenant, and made mention of Faith in it, as a means whereby he ſhould juſtifie ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, not that Faith is the cauſe of Gods acceptation of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of Chriſt, but of applying it to us.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>That which Mr.</hi> Eyre <hi>addeth, that our Saviour after
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:118254:135"/> he had taſted death, to bring many ſons to glory, boasts and glories in this atchievement,</hi> Behold, I and the children which thou haſt given me, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.13. <hi>Therefore it was the will of God that his death ſhould be immediately available for their reconciliation, for they could not be the children of wrath, and of Christ at the ſame time.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer, Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> hath dealt fraudulently in citing this Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, for he hath left out the 11th Verſ. which is the true Key to unlock this, and to ſhew us who are there called his children; for theſe that are called children, are called brethren in the 11th. Verſe, and the ſame perſons are underſtood without all queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and who were his brethren, why, they that were ſanctified; for both he that ſanctifieth, and they that are ſanctified, are all of one, wherefore he is not aſhamed to call them brethren. Now a man is not ſanctified before Faith, therefore not a brother be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Faith, therefore not a childe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The ſcope of the place is this, the Apoſtle is comforting the believing Hebrews againſt the ſcandall of the Croſſe, to which the Apoſtle anſwereth in <hi>v.</hi> 9. 1. <hi>That he was ſubjected unto death for our ſakes,</hi> not for his own, therefore his Croſſe ſhould not offend us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That he did but taſte of death, he was but a little while un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is was by the ſpecial grace of God, that his death for a ſhort time ſhould ſtand for our eternal death deſerved; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſhould rather gloriouſly eſteem of his ſuffering, then be offended.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He giveth a ſecond reaſon in the 10th Verſe, it made for Gods glory as well as for our ſalvation; for it behoved him, for whom are all things, and by whom, in bringing many ſonnes to glory, to make the Captaine of our ſalvation perfect through ſuffering In <hi>v.</hi> 11. he gives an account how Chriſt could die, and how this could be accepted in our ſtead. He anſwereth, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that he is one of our kin and nature.</hi> Now leaſt it ſhould therefore be thought that all are redeemed, becauſe all partake in the community of nature with Chriſt as man: He ſheweth who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed are his kindred, brethren, for whom he died, they are ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified ones; <hi>They that are ſanctified, and he that ſanctifieth, are
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:118254:135"/> all of one,</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, Chriſt died for them that are one with him: Now none are one with him, but ſuch, they are not only all of one common lump, but of the ſame body, and have the ſame God for their Father: Hence if none be united but ſanctified ones, and if Chriſt will claime kindred with none but ſanctified ones, then none but Believers are his brethren, and children. Now as to your Argument that they could not be the children of wrath, and of Chriſt at the ſame time, I retort it upon you, and ſay, therefore it is evident they were not Chriſts children immediately from the time of his death, for then they could not be children of wrath, which yet the Apoſtle expreſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirmeth of the Elect Epheſians, before regeneration. Thus the Captain of the Life-guard of his opinion, lieth bleeding at the feet of the truth that he doth oppoſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>If it were the will of God that the death of Chriſt ſhould be the payment of our debt, and a full ſatisfaction for all our iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, then was it his will that our diſcharge procured thereby ſhould be immediate: But it was the will of God that the death of Chriſt ſhould be the paiment of our debt, and a full ſatisfaction for our iniquities:</hi> Ergo.</p>
               <p>I deny the conſequence of the <hi>Major</hi> Propoſition, which he endeavoureth to prove, becauſe ſaith he, it is unjuſt that a debt when it is paid, ſhould be charged upon the Surety, or Principal.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, if it had been the intention of God and of Chriſt, that the payment ſhould have procured an immediat diſcharge; it were unjuſt: But that reſts to be proved, and will while the world ſtands. We deny not the value of the price or ſatisfaction, but that God or Chriſt intended it for a preſent diſcharge.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe Chriſts death, though it be the meritorious cauſe, yet it is not the only cauſe of Juſtification.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Chriſts was Gods ſervant in the work of Redemption, and if it were the will of God to limit this benefit till faith, it beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Chriſt as Mediatour to obey.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The merit of Chriſts death is not to be valued only by the intrinſecal value of it, but by the conſtitution and acceptation of God; it is ſaid, that by grace he taſted death for every man; It was an act of grace to Chriſt, that he ſhould be Mediatour, that the ſufferings of his humane nature, united to the divine perſon
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:118254:136"/> of the Son of God, ſhould be accepted as a ranſome for us from eternal death. Hence Chriſts death was not an act of pure ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, but of juſtice mixed with grace; and is ſo farre accepted, as the divine will of the Father pleaſeth, as we ſee in denying the fruit of it to Reprobates, and limiting it to the Elect, which might have ranſomed all. And why is it any more injuſtice to have it limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for a time by the will of God for application to the Elect, when it ſhall certainly be done, then to have it by the will of God abſolutely limited to them alone? Hence Chriſts death is ſo far meritorious, as the will of God is to accept it; hence Gods will muſt not be regulated by the death of Chriſt, for the time &amp; maner of application, or elſe it muſt be injuſtice in God, (which is a harſh expreſſion in you,) but Chriſts death muſt be regulated by Gods will in accepting it; and I have elſe where given ſufficient reaſon, why God did limit the benefit of it untill faith. And from what goeth before, it followeth Chriſts death was not <hi>ſolutio ejuſdem,</hi> but <hi>tantidem,</hi> for then it would have produced an immediate diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge. This is the great Argument upon which his cauſe depends; and you ſee how invincibly it is overmatcht, by oppoſing the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Juſtification by Faith.</p>
               <p n="3">3ly. <q>If nothing hindered the reconciliation of the Elect with God, but the breach of the Law, then the Law being ſatisfied, it was the will of God that they ſhould be immediatly reconciled; But nothing hindered their reconciliation with God, but the breach of the Law.</q> I ſhall here diſtinguiſh in anſwer to this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument upon the hinder<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ng of reconciliation. 1. Reconciliation may be hindered by that which is the cauſe of ſeparation, which at firſt made the breach; or reconciliation may be hindered for want of a fit means to apply the benefit of reconciliation. And thus I apply it to the <hi>Minor.</hi> And deny it, though nothing do hinder by way of guilt as a cauſe of ſeparation for want of ſatisfaction, yet ſomething did hinder by way of application, for the want of Faith as a meanes to unite the ſoul to Chriſt, hindered it; for as none are partakers of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, but ſuch as were in him; ſo none are partakers of the reconciliation wrought by Chriſt, but ſuch as are in him. Now it is by Faith that we are implanted into Chriſt, and therfore until Faith we are not partakers of the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of actual reconciliation. Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> doth erre <hi>toto coelo,</hi> when
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:118254:136"/> he thinketh we conceive a new will and aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ction to be in God upon believing, which was not before, for we acknowledge no new immanent act in God, this were to make him mutable; but we acknowledge a tranſient act of God to paſſe upon the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, and that there is a change of Gods diſpenſation toward the believer, though not a change of affection; and God loved them before with the love of benevolence, not with the love of complacency, and delight, which he could not do while they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained unjuſtified; The firſt love is terminated upon their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, (yet the nature of Juſtification conſiſts not in it, becauſe it is a love of good-will and purpoſe to do them good; The ſecond is a love terminated upon their graces, and ſo a delighting in his own work, &amp; ſo a loving them for what he hath wrought in them, and now he pardoneth by vertue of the Covenant of grace, and the promiſe, <hi>Whoſoever believe, ſhall not periſh, but have everlaſting life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>If it were the will of God that the ſin of</hi> Adam <hi>ſhould immediately overſpread his poſterity, then it was the will of God that the ſatisfaction and righteouſneſſe of Chriſt ſhould immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound to the benefit of Gods elect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This conſequence is denied, the reaſon that he bringeth, is, that there is the ſame reaſon for the immediat tranſmiſſion of both to their reſpective ſubjects; for as the Apoſtle ſheweth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.14, both of them were Heads and Roots of mankind. To which I anſwer, &amp; deny that there is the ſame reaſon for the immediate tranſmiſſion of both, for though they be both Roots of mankinde, yet we are in the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> in a naturall way, and ſo ſinned in him before we had a being, and were formally and actually ſinners as ſoon as we had an actual being; but we are in the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> by a ſupernatural work of the Spirit working Faith, and this is not wrought alwayes at our birth, but a long time after. Beſides, the ſcope of the Apoſtle is not to compare <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as cauſes in <hi>eodem genere,</hi> of the ſame kinde that did in the ſame manner, in every reſpect communicate the iſſues of their actions, to their reſpective members; but to ſhew that Chriſts death is no leſſe efficacious, nay, more powerfully efficacious to ſave all that are in him; then <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne were to condemn all that are in him; and the efficaciouſneſſe of Chriſts death conſiſts not in the immediate conferring of the things purchaſed, (for though
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:118254:137"/> in regerd of cauſality, the effects are immediat, yet not in reſpect of application;) but in the certainty of collating the things purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and the excellency of the things obtained; for it is farre mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e efficacious to ſave one man, then to damn all the world: The firſt is an act of Impotency, this an act of Omnipotency; and they for whom Chriſt died, ſhall as certainly be juſtified and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved as if the work were already done.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>If the ſacrifices of the Law were immediately available for the typical cleanſing of ſins under that administration, then the ſacrifice which Chriſt hath offered was immediately available, to make a real atonement for all thoſe ſinnes for which he ſuffered. The reaſon of which conſequence is this, becauſe the real ſacrifice is no leſſe efficacious then the typical,</hi> Heb. 9.14 <hi>But thoſe legal ſacrifices did immediately make atonement without any condition perfermed on the ſinners part,</hi> Lev. 16.30.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, that the conſequence of the <hi>major</hi> may juſtly be que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned; for if they were immediate, it followeth not that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſts ſacrifice muſt be ſo, or elſe it is of leſſe efficacy,</p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe that ſuch as brought thoſe ſacrifices were actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the people of God, and profeſſed faith in Chriſt, and if the Profeſſion were outward only, they had an outward clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing; if real, they had by faith in Chriſt a ſpiritual cleanſing, ſignified by the outward cleanſing, but all that ſhall be clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the ſacrifice of Chriſts death were not in being, much leſſe had an actual faith to apply it, nor is the death of Chriſt leſſe efficacious, becauſe they did but typically cleanſe, they could not purge the conſcience,<note place="margin">Heb. 9.25, 26.</note> hence they were often repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but Chriſt by one ſacrifice once offered hath cleanſed us, they had their power and efficacy only in reference to Chriſts blood, which was typified thereby.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we ſay that Chriſts death doth immediately cleanſe in reſpect of cauſality though not in reſpect of actual application, the defect is not in Chriſts blood, but in the want of faith, that it might be applied. But</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I deny the <hi>minor,</hi> thoſe legal ſacrifices did not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately make atonement without any condition on the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners part; for that is apparently falſe; For,</p>
               <p>Firſt, the man that would have an atonement made for him
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:118254:137"/> by ſacrifice, muſt have it be done by the ſlaying of a beaſt, offered up and burnt with fire, to ſignifie that without blood there <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

               <p>I anſwer, Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> is hardly put to it, that he muſt run to the Philiſtins to ſharpen his goad; this argument is taken from <hi>Suarez,</hi> who argueth againſt faith in general upon this ground, becauſe Infants are juſtified without it. Now this argument proveth, if it proveth any thing at all, that we are juſtified without it, and not before it, and ſo believers are not the ſole ſubjects of juſtification, as Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> elſewhere affirmeth; but the caſe of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants is not to be urged in moſt queſtions, eſpecially when we are ſpeaking of what God requires in thoſe that are <hi>adulti,</hi> of age unto ſalvation; but I deny his <hi>minor,</hi> and affirm that Infants are not united to Chriſt without ſaith, they are ſaved by faith as well as we.

                  <hi>Seventhly, if it were the Will of God, that Chriſt ſhould have the whole glory of our reconciliation, it was his Will that it ſhould not in the leaſt depend upon our works and conditions, becauſe that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions will ſhare with him in the glory of this effect, and our ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would be partly of works, and partly of grace, partly from Chriſt, and partly from our ſelves, nay, it would be more from our ſelves then Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I ſhall here diſtinguiſh upon conditions; A condition is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtrictly and properly taken for an abſolute condition, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red on our parts, performed by our ſelves without the help of grace, no way given and merited by Chriſt, upon which the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of Chriſts death ſhould depend, as a cauſe of the effect, if not deſerving, yet at leaſt-wiſe obliging God to give the effect; ſuch a condition would indeed ſhare with Chriſt, and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of our ſalvation would be aſcribed, partly to our ſelves, and partly to Chriſt; nay, we ſhould be more beholding to our ſelvs then to Chriſt, becauſe notwithſtanding all that he hath done, we might have been miſerable, unleſſe we had by the liberty of our Will, and improvement of our natural abilities performed this condition; but we deny and abhor ſuch a condition as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatory to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, a condition may be taken in a leſſe proper ſenſe, for an Evangelical condition appointed by God to ſuſpend the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:118254:139"/> of Chriſts death, till the condition be performed, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is not the fruit of free-will, but the abſolute purchaſe of Chriſt, and the free gift of God, and ſhall be infallibly given in the Lords due time to all, for whom Chriſt died, effectually to apply the benefit of his death unto juſtification; this condition we acknowledge, nor is it any wrong to Chriſt; for it is not the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for which we are juſtified, and it is the fruit of his death, and freely wrought by his own Spirit, and the death of Chriſt is not rendered the leſſe certain or effectual, but as abſolutely effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, as if the effects were already enjoyed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eighthly, If it were the Wil of God that his people ſhould have ſtrong conſolation, and that their joy ſhould be full, then it was his Will that their reconciliation ſhould not depend upon conditions performed by themſelves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer, that the conſolation and joy of Gods people is no whit leſſened, or abated by this condition before explained; for their ſalvation is as firme and ſure, as if that condition were not required, for they are not left to perform the condition by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſtrength; as for the condition which <hi>Calvin</hi> oppoſeth, it is a condition of works in the Papiſts ſenſe, not in ours. And when the Apoſtle ſaith,<note place="margin">Rom. 4.16.</note> 
                  <hi>Our ſalvation is of grace, that it might be ſure to all the ſeed;</hi> the ſame Apoſtle ſaith in the ſame verſe, <hi>It is of faith, that it might be of grace,</hi> and yet you are willing to leave out thoſe words, becauſe they make againſt you: nor is it leſſe ſure by faith,<note place="margin">Acts 16.48.</note> then if it were without it; for faith is merited, and ſhall be given, <hi>As many as were ordained to eternal life belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> This conſequence is denied, the argument maketh againſt a condition in an <hi>Arminian</hi> ſenſe, not in ours; for upon the firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that a man believeth he is juſtified, and all his ſins paſt are actually pardoned, his ſins to come virtually, ſo that no follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſin ſhall unjuſtifie him; though it may take away his aptitude for heaven, yet not his right: and though his ſin may deſerve damnation, and without actual repentance and faith he cannot
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:118254:139"/> be ſaved, yet grace ſhall be given to inable him to repent and believe, ſo that though there muſt be <hi>nova remiſſio,</hi> yet there is not <hi>nova juſtificatio;</hi> though a new remiſſion is needful, yet not a new juſtification; pardon of ſin is a continued act, but our juſtification <hi>quoad ſtatum</hi> is done <hi>ſimul &amp; ſemel,</hi> once and for all; this you know to be the Orthodox opinion, yet you frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulently conceal it, and oppoſe us, as if we held a condition in an <hi>Arminian</hi> ſenſe, and that ſo often as we fall into ſin, we fall from juſtification, and ſo no man could be ſure of ſalvation untill death.</p>
               <p>Tenthly, <hi>If it were the Will of God, that the death of Chriſt ſhould certainly procure reconciliation, then it was his Will it ſhould not depend upon termes and conditions performed by us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Still your conſequence doth halt down-right, for the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Elect is not uncertain as to the event, but as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>as the unchangeable decree of God can make it;</hi> but this is, <hi>Crambe bis vel ter recocta, &amp; faſtidium parit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Eleventhly, <hi>If he willed this bleſſing to his Elect by the death of Chriſt but conditionally, then he willed the reconciliation and juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Elect, no more then their non-reconciliation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> If Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> be not, he may; and I am aſhamed of this groſſe and wilful ignorance; I beleeve he knows it as well as he knows there is a God, that the Orthodox abhor theſe poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Remonſtrants, &amp; that we acknowledg that God willed the ſalvation of <hi>Peter</hi> with another manner of intention, then of <hi>Judas,</hi> and that we acknowledge no condition antecedently to their Election, but that he hath abſolutely predeſtinated the Elect unto the end, and as abſolutely to the meanes, and that God did not ſtand indifferent to the event, whether they ſhall be juſtified, ſaved or no, but abſolutely decreed them unto life as the end, unto juſtification as the meanes, unto faith as a means to bring them unto juſtification; ſo that though they be not ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified nor reconciled actually, yet he abſolutely willed that they ſhould be reconciled, and therefore gave Chriſt to die for them, and will give faith to apply the benefits of his death. As for the proof of his conſequence, if he willed their ſalvation only in caſe they believe, then he willed their condemnation if they believe not. I diſtinguiſh upon Gods Will, it is either ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:118254:140"/> or revealed, <hi>voluntas ſigni,</hi> or <hi>beneplacity; praecepti,</hi> or <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſiti;</hi> if you look to the will of Gods purpoſe, and his good-will and pleaſure, he abſolutely willed their reconciliation, ſo that nothing ſhall hinder it; but he did not will an abſolute reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation without Faith; there was no condition of his will, though of the thing willed; but if you look to the revealed will of God, the will of precept, ſo he declareth it is his will, that <hi>he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth ſhall be ſaved, and he that believeth not ſhall be damned,</hi> and thus he willeth their damnation if they believe not.</p>
               <p>Twelfthly, <hi>If God willed unto men the benefits of Christs death, upon any condition to be performed by them, it will follow that God foreſaw in them an ability to performe ſome good which Chriſt hath not merited, conditional reconciliation neceſſarily preſuppoſeth free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Still his arguments are guilty of this common fate to be lame in the conſequence, and to fall very ſhort of the mark intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; It doth not follow that God foreſaw any ſuch ability in man, nor doth ſuch a condition as we eſtabliſh, enthrone free-will; we yield him that God willed this bleſſing upon a poſſible condition; not poſſible to nature, but poſſible by grace; not becauſe man can performe it, (for it requireth the ſame Almighty power that was required to raiſe Chriſt from the dead, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.18,) but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God by his Spirit will work and give it. And thoſe he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth his adverſaries, do mean it in this ſenſe, it is a fruit of a promiſe made to Chriſt, and an effect of his death that Faith ſhall be given, but not a fruit of the Covenant made with us, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the condition by which we are really received into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
               <p>Thirteenthly, <hi>If God did will that our ſinnes ſhould be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Chriſt without any condition on our part, then was it his will that they ſhould be diſcounted without any condition on our part: But the Antecedent is true: Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer, 'tis pity that a man, whom we hope means well, that his Arguments ſhould go out like a ſnuffe of a candle in the ſock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, as theſe do; And I confeſſe it is a ridiculous argument, and inference, yet I will give a ſolution to it. I therefore deny his conſequence: It is readily granted, that the imputation of our ſinnes to Chriſt did not depend upon any condition of ours, for
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:118254:140"/> we had not then a being when this imputation was made, nor was it needful either for Chriſt, or us, that any condition on our parts ſhould be the ground of this imputation; it was a free act of God in mercy, taking off the guilt from us, and transferring it on Chriſt, and his ſole will and pleaſure was the cauſe of it; but that therefore it was the will of God that it ſhould without any ondition on our part be diſcounted to us, is a miſerable conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, more fit to be laughed at, then refuted. But to omit no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that may have the face, though not the force of an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unanſwered; I deny the conſequence, and the reaſon of it, and affirm that the charging our ſins upon Chriſt, was not our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge formally conſidered, the imputing out ſinnes to Chriſt was not a formall non-imputing them to us, virtually it was, it was a foundation laid for the non-imputing them to us, it was a paying the ranſome for us, a legal tranſlation of the eternal pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment upon Chriſt, a laying help upon one that was mighty; but this was not, nor is ever called in Scripture Juſtification: here is no formal imputation of any righteouſneſſe to us, who are not yet borne, much leſſe cited before a Tribunal, and abſolved from the guilt of ſinne. Beſides, 'tis not the charging of a ſurety with the debt, bue the diſcharging of him rather that carries the force of an Argument, to prove our diſcharge: but although Chriſt in his Reſurrection was legally diſcharged as a publik perſon, and all that he did repreſent, fundamentally, meritoriouſly, and cauſally; yet not perſonally, and formally, which is neceſſary to Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
               <p>Thus have I anſwered his Arguments, which he hath brought to prove the antecedency of Juſtification to Faith, there remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth yet one Argument, and Objection behinde, with which I ſhall put an end to this diſcourſe, leaving that which relateth to the Covenant to Mr. <hi>Woodbridge,</hi> to whom it peculiarly belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, from whom I doubt not but the world will receive a ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory anſwer. The Argument yet unanſwered, is this;</p>
               <p>If a man have the Spirit of God given him before he beleeve, then he muſt needs be juſtified before he doth beleeve, becauſe then he is in Covenant before he beleeveth, and he that is in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant is juſtified.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer; Firſt, by Conceſſion, willingly acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:118254:141"/> faith to be the Spirits work, and that no man can beleeve without the help of the Spirit working Faith.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I deny the Conſequence, that although the Spirit worketh Faith before we can beleeve, yet doth it not follow that a man is juſtified before beleeving. And the reaſon of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence I deny alſo, it followeth not that he is in Covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore beleeving, for there is no diſtance of time between the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the Spirit, our beleeving, and being juſtified, and in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, or being paſſed from the ſtate of death into a ſtate of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, becauſe there is a ſynchroniſme in theſe, in reſpect of time, they being altogether, as ſoone as ever there is fire there is heat; ſo as ſoone as the Spirit is given, Faith is wrought, and the perſon juſtified, and in Covenant, and ſanctified, at the ſame time; for God is able to act <hi>in inſtanti,</hi> in a moment; the Spirit is then ſaid to be given to us, when he doth manifeſt his Divine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence by working ſomthing in us peculiar to the elect, for though thoſe that ſhall periſh may be enlightened, and taſte of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the world to come, and may be ſaid to be partakers of the holy Ghoſt, yet properly none receive the Spirit but the Elect, and what others have is not a true ſaving work; now becauſe no work before Faith is truly ſaving, and have a neceſſary connex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion with ſalvation, therefore the Spirit is not received before Faith, and ſo they are <hi>ſimultanea,</hi> all together, the Spirit, Faith, and Juſtification, and being in Covenant; and therefore though there may be a precedency of nature in this gift of the Spirit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Faith, yet followeth it not that we are juſtified, and in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant before Faith, but at this very inſtant is the beleever taken into Covenant, and juſtified; and thus I willingly acknowledge the firſt grace is abſolutely given, to wit effectual vocation, or Faith, by which the ſoul is brought into an eſtate of Juſtification, and Faith is made the condition (though wrought by God) of our Juſtification. So that our being in Covenant and juſtified, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Faith in order of nature, which is contrary to that which Maſter <hi>Eyre</hi> hath all along contended for, that a man is juſtified from eternity, or from the time of Chriſts death, antecedently to our birth, and faith; and that the unregenerate, ſo remaining, if elected, are juſtified in that eſtate: which opinion, if it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, how it ſhould not deſtroy the vitals of Religion, is paſt
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:118254:141"/> my underſtanding to imagine. Having therefore had the glory of God, the vindication of this bleſſed truth, the ſalvation of the ſouls of Gods Elect, the preſerving them from Errour that are yet free from the infection of it, the reducing thoſe that are gone aſtray before mine eyes; and having with earneſt prayers unto God ſought for guidance herein, I undertook this task, and through his grace have finiſhed it; and I truſt I have not (I am ſure I have not willingly) departed from the truth: and if in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing I have written, I have erred from the truth, as <hi>humanum eſt errare,</hi> upon the firſt diſcovery of it I ſhall through the grace of Chriſt become a thankful Proſelyte; in the meane time I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the Chriſtian Reader to the grace of God in Chriſt. And the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Father of glory, tread down Satan under our feet, eſtabliſh and ſettle us in the truth, and give us to receive it in the love of it, and grant to us the Spirit of wiſdome, and revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the knowledge of him, that the eyes of our underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings may be enlightened, that we may know what is the hope of his calling, and what is the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the Saints, and by the exceding greatneſſe of his power, work Faith in the hearts of his Elect, where it is yet wanting; accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the working of his mighty power, and fulfil that which is lacking in our faith with power, and ſo keep us by his mighty power through faith unto this ſalvation, which is ready to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed at the ſecond coming of Chriſt, <hi>Amen.</hi>
